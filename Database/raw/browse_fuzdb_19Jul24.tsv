FC00002	P03070	SV40 NLS	Importin-α	X-ray	126-132	Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) facilitate the transport of proteins into the nucleus. Sequences flanking the basic clusters modulate recognition of the NLS. Proline residues in the flanking regions often appear to have a positive effect on NLS activity, likely by reducing the energetic cost of binding by restraining the NLS sequences in the extended conformation. The more stringent sequence requirements of the basic cluster of the monopartite NLSs are relaxed in the bipartite NLSs, by the second basic cluster compensating for the reduction of favorable contacts in the major site.The autoinhibitory sequence comprising residues 44-54 of importin-α binds to the major NLS binding site, resembling NLS binding. The path of the main chain of residues 47-53 is identical with the path of SV40 and nucleoplasmin NLS residues in the major binding site. Only residues 44-46 bind in a different mode than the analogous nucleoplasmin residues; however, in either case, few favorable interactions are formed in these regions with the protein, and the chains are poorly ordered.			Monopartite interaction with alternative conformations, which were observed (simultaneously) at specificity-determining subsites of V40 NLS and the N-terminal portion in the minor binding site (staggering one position N-terminally). The structures show the SV40 NLS binds in a very similar manner as mammalian NLS (residues 127-130).	pdb:1ejl		Alternative binding modes may account for diverse NLS binding by the same receptor and effective competition with mammalian NLSs.

FC00005	P15381	Dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR)	Ryanodine receptor (Ryr)	NMR, CD, AUC	724-760	Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling is the translation of an action potential on the surface membrane of a muscle fibre into Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the internal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> store, to trigger muscle contraction. Two Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are important in this signal transmission: the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The DHPR spans the transverse tubular membrane, detects action potential depolarization and communicates the depolarization to the RyR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release channel in the SR membrane.The mechanism of signalling between the two proteins differs between cardiac and skeletal muscle. In cardiac muscle, a depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> current through the DHPR initiates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the SR. In skeletal muscle the surface Ca<sup>2+</sup> current is not necessary for EC coupling. Instead, there is an interaction between the DHPR and RyR, requiring the cytoplasmic loop region between transmembrane repeats II and III of the skeletal DHPR a<sub>1</sub> subunit (Glu666-Leu791). Residues Phe725-Pro742 of the skeletal II-III loop are essential for skeletal-type EC coupling in myocytes. RyR activation occurs at 100 nm-10 &#181;M DHPR concentration. Peptide C of II-III loop of DHPR (724-760) has moderate affinity for RyR: 0.1-150 &#181;M. and  induces two independent stochastic processes. It could either bind to separate activation/inhibition sites, or simply bind to the same site in different conformations, which results in opposite biological effects. Biological data support the first scenario. At least two regions of the II-III loop of the DHPR (peptide A and C) can bind to separate sites on the RyR and that there are functional interactions between these binding sites when the loop regions are bound.			The structure of peptide C was examined using NMR and CD. Peptide C has a random-coil structure and therefore adopts different conformations. The peptide may only occasionally achieve the structure necessary to bind to activation or inhibition sites or to activate or inhibit at one site. This means that the concentration of peptide C in its active conformation is in fact lower than that indicated by the total concentration of the peptide.			The effects of peptide C indicate functional interactions between a part of the dihydropyridine receptor and the RyR. These interactions could reflect either dynamic changes that occur during excitation-contraction coupling or interactions between the proteins at rest.

FC00006	P13569	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channelregulatory (R) domain	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel	NMR	654-838	CFTR is a multifunctional protein, which provides the pore of a linear conductance chloride channel and also functions to regulate other membrane proteins. CFTR is regulated by phosphorylation at the intrinsically disordered regulatory (R) region. The R region has multiple effects on CFTR: it can contribute to activation or inhibition of the channel depending on the position and number of phosphorylation. The nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) preferably interacts with the non-phosphorylated R region. Binding occurs in a dynamic fashion with multiple, exchanging R sites. Phosphorylation reduces helical propensity and reduces NBD1 binding.			Assignments were obtained for 97% of the <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N, <sup>13</sup>Cα, <sup>13</sup>Cβ and C&#39; resonances of the nonphosphorylated R-region sequence and 99% of the resonances of the phosphorylated sequence, using a variety of triple-resonance experiments. Residues 718-722 in the nonphosphorylated R region lack assignments because of resonance broadening (loss of intensity accompanied by an increase in NMR resonance linewidth), probably resulting from millisecond- to microsecond-timescale sampling of a small population of stabilized conformations for these residues. Distinct segments of the R region have fractionally populated local helical structure, reflecting a bias of these residues toward helical conformations in the pool of conformers. In the nonphosphorylated R region, residues 654-668, 759-764, 766-776 and 801-817 all have a greater than 5% a-helical population. Phosphorylation produces a global decrease in helical content, consistent with that observed in circular dichroism experiments. Phosphorylation generally decreases R<sub>2</sub> relaxation rates. Upon adding NBD1, ratios of peak intensities varied from 0 to 1.3, with broad rather than sharp minima, reflective of longer stretches of residues interacting with varying affinities and no global disorder-to-order transition. Several segments of the R region appear to bind NBD1, to various degrees, implying dynamic exchange of several R-region binding segments on and off NBD1. The presence of fractional helical structure in the free state of the R region and changes in resonance intensity over several stretches of 10-15 residues upon binding to NBD1 provide evidence that R-region interactions are mediated by stabilization of fluctuating helical structural elements.		bmrb:15336, bmrb:15340	Dynamic interactions modulated by phosphorylation of the fuzzy region regulate channel opening via variable interactions with the NBD1 domains.

FC00011	Q29122	Myosin VI	Actin filament	EM	840-920	Myosin VI is a molecular motor, which is widely expressed in different tissues and is also involved in endocytosis. It moves processively along actin and dimers take multiple steps on actin filaments. Insertion of GCN4 into the proximal tail domain yields steps that are both shorter and more regular in comparison to myosine VI construct, highlighting the key role of the proximal tail in the diffusive search.			EM shows that the observed distance between the centers of the two heads of myosine VI construct is 27 ± 6 nm. This value is greater than expected if the two heads were held together at the C terminal end of the IQ/CaM domain, where the heads should span no more than ~18 nm. EM shows that the proximal tail alone does not act as a rigid extension of the lever arm. Instead, the proximal tail acts as a flexible linker connecting the heads.			Fuzzy segments enable the step-size mechanism to find new electrostatic interactions. The flexible coupling is necessary for the load-induced switching from motor activity to an anchor. Another possibility is that this motor is designed to straddle neighboring actin filaments in its role in the inner ear or in endocytosis, and therefore needs unusual flexibility.

FC00014	P02470	αA-crystallin	high molecular mass (HMM) complexes with insulin, α-lactalbumin ovotransferrin	NMR, UV-VIS, FS	163-173	α-crystallin belongs to the family of small heat shock proteins. It forms a dynamic multimeric complex of two subunits in eye lens. The disordered C-terminal extension has impact on the chaperone activity. Increasing hydrophobicity of the C terminal extension, by even inserting one tryptophane residue greatly diminishes ability to prevent aggregation of insulin B-chains. Increasing chaperone activity is related to exposure of more hydrophobic residues in the C terminal region.			Most of the protein forms β-sheets, with a disordered C-terminal extension. NMR data show that upon chaperone activity, α-crystallin does not undergo gross structural alterations: it largely retains flexibility of the C terminal part even in complex with its substrates (it is only in αA and not in αB subunit).			The disordered C-terminal tail is required for solubilisation of αA-crystallin and enable hydrophobic regions to be exposed to interact with the substrate.

FC00016	P04050	RNA polymerase II C terminal domain	mRNA maturation factors	X-ray	1451-1733	Unphosphorylated RNAP II CTD is required for initiation of transcription and interacts with a range of general transcription factors. After initiation of transcription, the CTD interacts with kinases (e.g. TFIIH) and is phosphorylated, which ultimately leads to exclusion of initiation factors and formation of the elongation complex. Capping enzymes associate with the phospho-CTD, which also orchestrates the mRNA splicing machinery. Phosphorylation status of the CTD determines the stage of transcription. Owing to the lack of CTDs Pol I and III promoters are unable to generate transcripts, which are capable of mRNA processing.	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Largest and catalytic component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Forms the polymerase active center together with the second largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB1 is part of the core element with the central large cleft, the clamp element that moves to open and close the cleft and the jaws that are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. Regulation of gene expression levels depends on the balance between methylation and acetylation levels of tha CTD-lysines. The CTD is highly soluble and contains 26 heptapeptide repeats of the consensus sequence YSPTSPS.

Its essential functional property, the ability to contract reversibility after stretching. 	Elastin is one of the most ubiquitous proteins of the mammalian extracellular matrix and is the main protein to confer elasticity to biological tissues through the formation of a network of fibres. The protein consists of an alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic domain structure. The hydrophobic regions feature non-polar amino acids, often arranged in repetitive motifs, the most common being VGVAPG. Overall, hydrophobic residues account for ~80% of the primary sequence.	LLPSDB:p0278	Solid-state NMR provides evidence for a high degree of dynamic disorder within the fibrils, with random-coil-like secondary chemical shift values of all backbone carbon atoms. Tightly bound waters are absent in both dry and hydrated elastin and (ii) that the backbone in the hydrated protein is highly disordered with large amplitude motions. Comparison of the observed shifts with accepted values for α-helices, β -sheets, or random coils indicates a random coil structure at all carbons.			(1) A fundamental requirement for elastomeric domains is to remain disordered, even when aggregated; (2) disorder is an indirect consequence of the inability of the polypeptide to form a compact, water-excluding core involving extensive backbone self-interactions; (3) most significantly, the fact that a minimum threshold of combined P, G content appears to be fulfilled by proteins forming such diverse biomaterials as human aorta, spider silk, and lizard egg shells suggests that maintaining a critical level of disorder is not only a fundamental requirement but may very well constitute the single most essential design principle of self-assembling elastic proteins.

The H1 CTD also has been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions involved in H1-dependent activation of the apoptotic nuclease, DFF40/ CAD.Linker histones in general are multifunctional, with roles in chromatin condensation nucleosome spacing, specific gene expression DNA methylation and other nuclear processes. In addition to chromatin, linker histones bind to many nuclear proteins, e.g., DFF40/CAD, BAF, Purα/YB1. The CTD region that binds to the enzyme is large and partially overlaps with the two CTD regions that bind linker DNA and stabilize condensed chromatin. Interestingly, all somatic linker histone isoforms activated the enzyme identically in vitro. Moreover, all free CTD peptides that were at least 47 residues in length could bind to and activate the enzyme, regardless of their primary sequence and original location in the intact CTD. Thus, amino acid composition and location of the CTD region relative to the winged helix domain also appear to be the determinants of CTD-protein interactions.Detailed studies show that randomization of sequence not, but shifting composition affects function of the H1 CTD.			CTD is absent from crystal structure of the nucleosome, indicating that it is partly disordered in the bound state.

Five Ure2p variants in which the order of the amino acids in the prion domain was randomly shuffled while keeping the amino acid composition and C-terminal domain unchanged. Surprisingly, all five formed prions in vivo, with a range of frequencies and stabilities, and the prion domains of all five readily formed amyloid fibers in vitro.Ure2 forms prions primarily as a result of its sequence composition, as versions of Ure2 with the prion domain amino acids shuffled are still able to form prions. It was shown that prion induction by both Ure2 and Ure2-21, one of the scrambled versions of Ure2, is clearly dependent on the length of the inducing fragment. For Ure2-21p, no single sequence is found in all of the inducing fragments, highlighting the sequence independence of prion formation.			1-89 region remains disordered in the complex, with Ure2 prion amyloid based on EM, CYT data.

The sequence of the Sup35 prion domain can be randomized without blocking prion formation. Indeed, a single shuffled sequence could give rise to several prion variants. These results suggest that [PSI<sup>+</sup>] formation is driven primarily by the amino acid composition of the Sup35 prion domain, and that the Sup35 oligopeptide repeats are not required for prion maintenance.	Sup35 is an archetypal prion domain–containing protein. Involved in translation termination. Stimulates the activity of ERF1. Binds guanine nucleotides. Recruited by polyadenylate-binding protein Pab1 to poly(A)-tails of mRNAs. Interaction with Pab1 is also required for regulation of normal mRNA decay through translation termination-coupled poly(A) shortening.The C-proximal region of Sup35 (Sup35C), essential for cell viability and translation termination, is conserved from yeast to humans, the prion-forming N-terminal domain (Sup35N) and the middle region (Sup35M) exhibit a high level of divergence.N (N) and middle (M) domain are disordered.

FC00031	P62326	Thymosine β4	Actin	NMR, SAXS, SDM	13-43	Thymosines are small actin binding proteins, which serve to sequester actin.Thymosin-β4 (Tβ4) is the most abundant and well-studied member of the family, which promotes cell migration. Tβ4 acts also extracellularly with less understood mechanisms to enhance embryonic endothelial cell migration, promote dermal and corneal wound healing or stimulate coronary vasculogenesis. These C-terminal interaction dynamics are controlled by the strength of electrostatic interactions with G-actin. At physiological ionic strength, a single salt bridge with actin located next to their central LKKT/V motif induces G-actin sequestration. A single mutation K14Q however supports actin assembly. This mutation decreases affinity for G-actin by 17-fold.			Functionally different βT/WH2 domains differ by distinct dynamics of their C-terminal half interactions with G-actin pointed face. At high ionic strength the C-terminal dynamics increases which contributes to elongation. Low dynamics at normal/weak ionic strength enhances the salt bridge formation and restricts dynamics, corresponding to a structural state relevant for sequestration.	pdb:3u9d		Fuzziness enables two opposite functions (actin polymerization vs disassembly), which is controlled by the ionic strength via screening a single charge-charge interaction.

This profilin-like activity accounts for Ciboulot in vivo function in axonal during metamorphosis. Ciboulot can interact with G-actin in non-polymerizing low ionic strength conditions (G- buffer), more dynamically than thymosin β. These data suggested that the switch of function of βT domains from inhibition to promotion of actin assembly might depend on different still ill-defined interactions of their C-terminal region with actin subdomains 2 and 4, mediated by sequence variations widely distributed within their C-terminal half.Dynamics of Ciboulot could be decreased by introducing the Thymosine linker and increase the affinity for G-actin.			Whether the WH2 domain inhibits or promotes actin assembly is largely determined by the dynamic interaction of the central and C-terminal regions of the WH2 domain with actin subdomains 1 and 2.	pdb:3u9z		Because actin subdomain-2 is itself disordered, the plasticity of WH2 might induce different structures of subdomain-2 upon binding.

FC00034	P0A7K2	L7/L12 ribosomal protein	Ribosome	NMR	32-51	The acidic L7/L12 is a ribosomal protein, which binds and enhances activity of GTPases. Flexibility and conformation is modulated by binding of elongation factors to the ribosome. Depletion in L7/L12 inhibits protein synthesis and decreases elongation factor activity. Shortening of the L7/L12 interdomain region decreases the translation rate in vitro and proteins without the interdomain regions are not active. Increasing the length of the interdomain region results in lower level of miscoding. It was shown by site-directed mutagenesis and deletion studies that the length of the interdomain region of the L7/L12 protein, but not the amino acid sequence has a crucial effect on ribosomal function.			This protein is invisible in crystal structure of the 50S ribosome and highly disordered in 70S.

FC00038	P09803	E-cadherin	β-catenin	X-ray	636-653, 685-697	The cytosolic protein β-catenin has essential roles in cell adhesion and in signal transduction. β-catenin is a component of adherens junctions, sites of cell-cell contact in which the actin cytoskeletons of adjacent cells are linked through cadherin cell adhesion molecules β-catenin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins and to β-catenin, which in turn binds directly to F-actin and other actin-associated proteins. Cell junctions are dynamic and regulated assemblies, and several mechanisms, including phosphorylation of junction components, appear to control cadherin-based adhesion. Phosphorylation of E-cadherin enhances cell adhesiveness and the affinity of the E-cadherin/β-catenin complex. The enhanced binding of phosphorylated E-cadherin or the decreased binding of E-cadherin upon phosphorylation of β-catenin Tyr654 demonstrate that the overall affinity can be modulated without completely eliminating the interaction of these two proteins.The region between E-cadherin residues 684 and 699 contains several serine residues in consensus positions for casein kinase II (CKII) - and GSK-3β -mediated phosphorylation. Substituting these serine residues with alanine reduces β-catenin/E-cadherin complex formation and diminishes cell-cell adhesion.			E<sub>cyto</sub> residues 685-697 of E-cadherin are not visible in the unphosphorylated complex structures, suggesting that phosphorylation is required for their association with β-catenin. In the crystal structure of the phos-Ecyto/β-catenin complex, E-cadherin residues 685-694 are visible, with ordered phosphate groups present on Ser684, Ser686, and Ser692.	pdb:1i7x		Fuzziness enables multiple, quasi-independent interactions between β-catenin and E-cadherin.

FC00039	P18272	Ebola virus nucleoprotein	virion protein 35 (VP35)	ELFO, EM	439-492, 589-739	The Ebola virus nucleoprotein (NP) is an essential component of the nucleocapsid, required for filovirus particle formation and replication. Together with virion protein 35 (VP35) and VP24, this gene product gives rise to the filamentous nucleocapsid within transfected cells. The 439-492 and 589-739 regions, which determine this aberrant migration of Ebola NP also mediate its incorporation into virions. When the 438-739 region was appended to either measles NP or RSV NP, the fusion protein, in contrast to the parental NP, was able to bind VP35 by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting.			Ebola virus NP migrates aberrantly, with an apparent molecular mass of 115 kDa, although it is predicted to encode an approx. 85-kDa protein. This is mostly owing to two domains (439 to 492 and 589 to 739).			Fuzziness of the filovirus-unique region of NP contributes to both the assembly and the morphology of this distinct class of viruses.

FC00040	P38634	Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1	Cell division control protein 4 (Cdc4)	NMR	1-90	Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1 interacts with the SCF ubiquitin ligase subunit Cdc4 in yeast. Phosphorylation of Sic1 induces binding to a WD40 domain in Cdc4 leading to ubiquitination and degradation of Sic1. The phosphorylation-dependent degradation of Sic1 in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle enables the development of B-type cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase activity and the onset of DNA replication. It has been demonstrated that the phosphodegrons of Sic1 consist of suboptimal binding motifs for binding to the WD40 domain. Out of 9 motifs 6 has to be phosphorylated for optimal binding, although only one of them can physically interact with the target.Binding via a single, high-affinity site causes aberrant cell-cycle.			It was shown by NMR that multiple phosphorylated sites on Sic1 interact with Cdc4 in dynamic equilibrium with only local ordering around each site. Regardless of phosphorylation status, Sic1 exists in an intrinsically disordered state but is surprisingly compact with transient structure.	pdb:3v7d	bmrb:16659, bmrb:16657	Fuzziness prohibits premature degradation of Sic1, which could lead to genome instability.

FC00041	P0AG11	UmuD&#39;2	UmuD&#39;2	CD, NMR	25-37	The bacterial SOS response is a tightly regulated reaction to stress-induced DNA damage. It is temporally divided into an early, relatively accurate DNA repair phase and a later, more mutagenic damage-tolerance phase. This timing is regulated in part by products of the umuD gene. The initial product, UmuD2</sub>, is a homodimer composed of 139 amino acid subunits that appears early after SOS induction. Damage-induced RecA:ssDNA nucleoprotein filaments mediate a slow autocleavage of UmuD2</sub> that is mechanistically similar to the inactivation of the LexA repressor. The N-terminal 24 amino acids of each subunit of UmuD2</sub> are removed, leaving a homodimer of the C-terminal 115 amino acid subunits, UmuD&#39;<sub>2</sub>. UmuD&#39;<sub>2</sub> activates UmuC, the catalytic subunit of the Y family DNA polymearse (Pol) V, for mutagenic translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). UmuD2</sub> participates in a DNA damage checkpoint while the closely related UmuD&#39;<sub>2</sub> acts in translesion synthesis and inhibition of homologous recombination. Some positions that are predicted to be far away from the dimer interface also cross-link. However, these residues can come together if the N-terminal arms are in an intermediate conformation. These results suggest that UmuD2 may interchange among multiple conformations in solution.Since the conformation of the N-termini is the major difference between UmuD2 and UmuD&#39;2, contacts involving the N-terminal arms or the region of the core buried by the UmuD arm are expected to contribute to the distinctive interactions of UmuD&#39;2. Indeed, most of the mutations that enhance UmuD&#39;2C-dependent inhibition of homologous recombination lie within the N-terminal arms of UmuD&#39;2, with E35K having the greatest effect on binding. Different contacts with DNA pol III enable UmuD&#39;2 to promote translesion synthesis and UmuD2 to effect a DNA damage checkpoint.			Despite forming stable homodimers at a wide range of physiologically relevant concentrations, UmuD2 and UmuD&#39;2 have circular dichroism (CD) spectra with almost no α-helix or β-sheet signal at physiological concentrations in vitro resembling that of a random coil. High protein concentrations, osmolytic crowding agents, and specific interactions with a partner protein can produce CD spectra that resemble the expected β -sheet signature.	pdb:1i4v		Fuzziness enables to adapt to multiple distinct protein-protein interactions of these gene products despite of the small size and posttranslational modifications further differentiate these interactions. UmuD2 and UmuD&#39;2 may act as interchangeable interaction domains for the two Y family DNA polymerases in Escherichia coli, thus allowing for a streamlined genome while maintaining the regulatory sensitivity of the interaction module.

FC00042	P61244	Protein Max	DNA	NMR, CD, AUC	1-18, 93-132	Max belongs to the family of b-HLH-LZ (helix-loop-helix, leucine zipper) transcription factors, which contains numerous proteins including the Myc and Mad families. Max recognizes and binds E-Box DNA sequences as a homodimer in vitro and represses transcription of Myc target genes in vivo. The two major isoforms differ in the insertion N terminal to the basic region. The gene product p21 Max has a K<sub>D</sub> of 7 &#215; 10<sup>-6</sup>, a value 10-100 times smaller than the b-HLH-LZ itself. This indicates that the disordered N- and C- terminal portions of p21 are involved in the stabilization of the homodimer.			In its free form, Max dominantly exists as a homodimer, with the LZ domain adopting a helical structure. The LZ region, however, is unstable, and undergoes folding-unfolding transitions. This equilibrium s shifted towards the folded state by the N- and C-terminal segments, which remain as a random coil even in the dimer form.Biologically important regions flanking its bHLH-Zip motif are disordered or absent in crystal structures. These regions are resistant to proteolysis in both the presence and absence of DNA, and that Max dimers containing both flanking regions have significantly higher helix content as measured by circular dichroism than that predicted from the crystal structures.Owing to additional mobility in the ms to s time scale, the NMR data clearly indicate that only a limited part of the residues in Max<sub>1-132</sub> can be disordered.	pdb:1hlo, pdb:1r05		Fuzzy regions could modulate DNA binding affinity by modulating the helical content of b-HLH-LZ via an electrostatic mechanism.

FC00044	Q13569	Thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG)	DNA	NMR	340-410	Thymine-DNA glycosylases (TDGs), proteins of the Escherichia coli MUG family, have the ability to detect and repair thymine bases in DNA in the context of G · T mismatches in addition to a G · U repair activity in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. The human TDG and MBD4/MIG proteins thereby display lower G · T than G · U repair activity. Deletion of the 1-50 residues of NTD as well as the deletion of the full C-terminus leads to a significant increase of TDG glycosylase activity.			NMR data show that a region encompassing 60 residues immediately preceding the catalytic domain and specifically required for G · T repair undergoes a dramatic dynamic change in the context of the entire protein. Even though the isolated N-terminus exhibits an overall extended conformation, this same region still adopts a small degree of organization and is able to bind small double-stranded DNA molecules in a sequence-independent manner. In contrast, region 1-50 of the N-terminus adopts a totally disordered structure. This region is neither affected by the absence of the catalytic domain nor interacts with DNA directly.			Fuzzy regions shift populations towards the DNA-binding competent conformation. In addition, the fluctuating C-terminal domain provides a steric hindrance in the complex and imparts length-dependent regulation on substrate-binding affinity.

The DNA-binding residues are mainly located on the C-half of the ApLLP molecule, involving a lysine rich motif. This plays a critical role in interacting with the CRE DNA sequence.			All three ApLLP forms had the far-UV CD spectra typical of a highly unstructured protein lacking of any predominant secondary structure.ApLLP is capable of binding the CRE DNA element but this induces no significant change in its secondary and tertiary structures. No significant increase in the HSQC spectral dispersion was observed for ApLLP-87 in complex with DNA, indicating that the binding would not induce the formation of the tight tertiary packing. The far-UV CD spectrum only underwent very minor changes, indicating that the secondary structure changes of ApLLP-87 triggered by DNA-binding were very subtle.			Fuzziness of ApLLP might enable dynamic regulation of synaptic facilitation in Aplysis neurons.

Phosphorylation has minimal impact on the secondary structure of the SRR region. Upon phosphorylation she most pronounced differences are in the dynamic properties of the HI-1 autoinhibitory helix and recognition helices H1 and H3. These units form a hydrophobic network, whose motions are dampened by SRR phosphorylation.	pdb:1mdm		The dynamic character of Ets-1 is likely essential for sequence-specific DNA binding andalso provides an opportunity for gradual regulation of DNA binding (rheostat) depending on length and phosphorylation stage.

FC00048	P0AGE0	Single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB)	DNA	X-ray, FA	113-177	The Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein (SSB) plays roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair by stabilizing ssDNA intermediates that are generated during DNA processing. In addition, SSB interacts with a number of proteins involved in DNA metabolism using its C-terminal domain via four intrinsically disordered tails. The binding of ssDNA to SSB is inhibited by the SSB C-terminal tails, specifically by the last 8 highly acidic amino acids that comprise the binding site for its multiple partner proteins. At moderate salt concentration, removal of the acidic C-terminal ends increases the intrinsic affinity for ssDNA and enhances the negative cooperativity between ssDNA binding sites, indicating that the C termini exert an inhibitory effect on ssDNA binding. This inhibitory effect decreases as the salt concentration increases. Binding of ssDNA to approximately half of the SSB subunits relieves the inhibitory effect for all of the subunits.		PhaSepDB:P0AGE0 region:1-170,1-178	The crystal structure of full-length homotetrameric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein from Escherichia coli (SSB) has been determined to 3.3 &Aring; resolution and reveals that the entire C-terminal domain is disordered even in the presence of ssDNA. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain of the protein is well-ordered and is virtually indistinguishable from the previously determined structure of the chymotryptic fragment of SSB (SSBc) in complex with ssDNA.

PC4 has also been shown to repress transcription under specific conditions. Owing to the presence and transient interactions of the fuzzy NTD, the ssDNA binding affinity and the DNA unwinding activity of PC4 are both reduced. DNA-binding and DNA-unwinding activity are increased by both deletion of the whole amino terminus and mutation of specific positive-charged residues.		PhaSepDB:P53999	The moderate NOE signal intensities, in combination with the chemical-shift data, indicate that NTD regions are predominantly unstructured in nature, which suggests either a pliable structure or exchange between the random-coil and more ordered structures.NMR data show that the disordered NTD region establishes transient, dynamic interactions with the structured CTD and these compete with the ssDNA binding sites.

FC00050	P53999	Positive cofactor 4 (PC4)	VP16	NMR	1-60	PC4 can act as a cofactor for many different transcription activators. With VP16 Kd is 90±20 nM, for CTD 150±80 nM, while deletion of the amino-terminal domain of PC4 (PC4 NTD) diminishes the interaction with VP16ad. The N terminal domain (PC4 NTD) region can cooperate with the conserved carboxy-terminal core of the protein (PC4 CTD) to increase the interaction of PC4ctd with VP16ad. The PC4 NTD alone lacks the ability to interact with ssDNA, dsDNA, and VP16ad and does not possess any helix-destabilizing activity. The precise role as well as the mechanism underlying the regulation of the PC4 function by its amino-terminal domain is unclear. The presence of PC4 NTD can either be stimulatory (VP16 interaction), neutral (dsDNA), or inhibitory (ssDNA) on the PC4 CTD functions. The interaction between the VP16 activation domain (VP16ad) and PC4 are highly salt-dependent and influenced by pH, indicating that the interactions are predominantly electrostatic in nature.		PhaSepDB:P53999	Upon interaction with VP16ad, not significant changes in NOE contacts for PC4 NTD were observed, which suggest that PC4ntd is highly flexible and mostly unstructured both in the free form and in the complex with the activator. The <sup>15</sup>N-T values indicate some enhanced mobility on the pico-nanosecond time scale in the first part of the lysine-rich region (&Tilde;20-29), when compared to the rest of PC4 NTD. The addition of VP16 to PC4 resulted in progressive amide peak shifts, indicative for fast exchange on the NMR time scale and characteristic of a low-affinity complex.Significant chemical-shift changes are also observed for the strongly positively charged lysine-rich region (21-48) and the amino-terminal end (3-8 residues) of PC4 NTD. Upon the interaction with VP16ad, no peak broadening or decrease of signal intensity is observed for PC4 NTD to the extent of PC4 CTD and NOE contacts are present in comparable proportions as for PC4 alone. These observations exclude the formation of a tight complex between PC4 NTD and VP16ad bound to PC4 CTD. The affected site in PC4ntd might be involved in the electrostatic attraction of VP16ad, bringing the activator in proximity of the PC4 CTD interaction surface, thereby affecting the on/off rate of VP16 toward PC4.	pdb:2phe		Transient and dynamic interdomain interactions between the unstructured PC4 NTD and structured PC4 CTD overlapping with the ssDNA/VP16ad interaction surface that affects the cofactor activities of PC4.

FC00052	P63159	High-mobility protein group B1 (HMGB1)	DNA	NMR, SAXS, PRE	186-215	High mobility group (HMG) protein B1 (HMGB1) participates in various nuclear processes. HMGB1 bends DNA significantly, and it appears to act primarily as an architectural facilitator in the assembly of nucleoprotein complexes, in which the bound DNA is often tightly bent.Histone H1 and the non-histone high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) are chromatin components that have opposite effects on chromatin stability. H1, present at one molecule per nucleosome on average, stabilizes both the nucleosome and chromatin higher-order structure, whereas HMGB1, which is about 10-fold less abundant, is a potential destabilizer and may act in conjunction with chromatin remodelling complexes. Both HMGB1 and H1 are highly mobile in vivo, with high on/off rates of association with chromatin. This mobility could provide windows of opportunity during which one protein could replace the other in chromatin. For example, HMGB1 could effectively displace H1 by competing for its binding site, or part of it, resulting in local destabilization of chromatin and possibly recruitment of other proteins, leading to transcriptional activation. A series of HMGB1 tail-truncation mutants differing from each other by five residues was generated. Chemical-shift perturbation mapping using these mutants shows that tails of different lengths bind with different affinities. The acidic tail also stabilizes the protein against thermal denaturation.			By CD measurements the tail in full-length HMGB1 adopts a random-coil conformation, and the secondary and tertiary structure are unaffected by tail length in the truncated HMGB1 variants. NMR experiments show that a large proportion of the tail resonances shift, indicating that the tail makes extensive contacts with the body of the protein. The proximal half of the tail (residues 185-199) primarily contacts the N- and C-terminal regions of each box, and the concave face of the B box. The next ten residues (200-209) contact the concave face of the A box. The five residues that extend the tail from &#916;15 to &#916;10 (residues 200-204) appear to be involved directly in recruiting the A box to the assembly.Long- range NOEs between the tail and the boxes/linkers indicate that it does not appear to adopt any stable secondary structure. The tail-bound states must be a dynamic equilibrium between the more compact, tail-bound form(s) and &#39;open&#39;, free forms in which the DNA-binding surfaces are accessible. Relaxation enhancements indicate the existence of a &#39;sandwich&#39;-like collapsed structure in which the tail enables the close approach of the basic domains.	pdb:2gzk		Dynamic association of HMGB1 with chromatin and provide a mechanism by which protein-protein interactions or posttranslational modifications might regulate the function of the protein at particular sites, or at particular stages in the cell cycle.

FC00053	P83949	Homeotic protein ultrabithorax (Ubx)	DNA, Exd	CD, proteolysis	1-174, 175-216, 244-286	Development of all bilaterally symmetric animals requires reliable temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression by members of the Hox protein family. Hox proteins are expressed in contiguous domains along the anterior-posterior axis, where they regulate region-specific differentiation, patterning, and proliferation. Misexpression of a Hox protein transforms one region into another, altering tissue and appendage fates. These dramatic phenotypes underscore the absolute requirement for specific and reliable Hox function in vivo. Ultrabithorax regulates the development of halteres and the posterior-most pair of thoracic legs from analogous tissues. The disparity between the absolute requirement for distinct Hox activities in vivo and the similarity of homeodomain-DNA recognition in vitro has been termed the &#39;Hox paradox&#39;.This paradox is resolved, in part, through Hox interactions with other transcription factors, increasing specificity by requiring tandem Hox and partner DNA binding sites. Since the expression and activity of many Hox partners is limited to specific tissues, protein interactions potentially provide contextual information to Hox proteins as well as contribute to target site selection. The structured homeodomain (HD) of the Hox transcription factor Ubx binds its optimal DNA sequence with very high affinity (K<sub>d</sub>=63±24 pM), yet with little ability to distinguish target DNA sequences in vivo (3-fold variation in affinity). By contrast, the full-length Ubx has lower affinity, yet higher selectivity for the optimal DNA sequence (K<sub>d</sub>=160±33 pM, 12-fold affinity variation), which indicates that regions outside the HD are important for DNA affinity and sequence selectivity. Most of the non-HD regulatory regions have ID character. The I1 region of Ubx reduces affinity twofold, and the I2 region reduces affinity a further 40-fold; both via the competitive binding mechanism. The R region restores much of this loss in affinity in a length-dependent manner.			Native proteolysis experiments indicate that three disordered regulatory regions (I1,I2 and R). CD spectroscopy shows negative ellipticity ~ 200 nm, which is characteristic to disordered regions.	pdb:1b8i		Fuzzy region based regulatory mechanisms enable Ubx to sense tissue identity and respond by implementing a context-specific gene regulatory cascade.

FC00054	P22808	NK2 homeodomain (NKX3.1)	DNA	NMR	86-95, 99-105	NKX3.1 is a homeodomain (HD) protein belonging to the NK-2 family, a class of transcription factors critical for the development of many organs. NKX3.1 is a prostate tumor suppressor. AD and SI motif interactions might be responsible for the weaker DNA binding previously observed for the N-terminal NKX3.1 (1-184) construct. Consequently, the transcription factors could recruit NKX3.1 via favorable AD or SI interactions, competing with their homeodomain interactions, and thus could increase the strength of binding of NKX3.1 to adjacent DNA sites.The observed interactions were weak, with effective binding constants no stronger than 0.5 mM; however, because the interacting domains are covalently linked, their effective concentration for interaction is predicted to be in the millimolar range.Based on polymer theory, effective concentrations for interactions between domains connected by flexible linkers are predicted to be in the millimolar range, and thus, the weak intramolecular interactions observed here could conceivably modulate or compete with stronger, intermolecular interactions with the NKX3.1 HD.			NMR signals from a region of NKX3.1 preceding the HD intensify upon binding of NKX3.1 to DNA, an effect most likely due to this region becoming more flexible and mobile. This region, which contains the acidic domain (AD) and SRF interacting (SI) motifs, interacts with the HD but becomes displaced when the HD binds to DNA. The NMR signals for the entire N-terminal region preceding the HD, including the AD and SI motifs, exhibit poor chemical shift dispersion, have strong intensities, and have C<sup>R</sup> and C<sup>β</sup> chemical shift values typical of a flexible, disordered peptide structure. The AD and SI regions appear to be fully flexible by NMR, even when interacting with the homeodomain.	pdb:1nk2		Fuzziness enables combinatorial usage of AD and Si interactions. The implication is that transcription factors could recruit NKX3.1 via favorable AD or SI interactions, competing with their homeodomain interactions, and thus could increase the strength of binding of NKX3.1 to adjacent DNA sites. Because of their high effective concentrations, these weak intra- molecular interactions could effectively compete with sub- micromolar binding constants and concentrations typical of inter- molecular interactions inside cells.

These multi-domain transcription factors bind to DNA elements from which they regulate gene expression. PPAR-γ LBD interface with RXR-a DBD contributes to the DNA binding of the complex. Phe 347 is near the surface of the LBD, and distant from both the ligand-binding pocket and coactivator docking sites and DNA binding assays show that the Phe347Ala-mutant PPAR-γ negatively affects PPRE binding.			However, the A/B segments could not be visualized in any of the three complexes, presumably because of their high mobility. The dynamic properties were examined using amide hydrogen/ deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (H/D-Ex). In all samples, the most rapidly exchanging region was the A/B portion. Sequence alignments further demonstrate that these receptors lack significant stretches of hydrophobic residues and/or a meaningful level of amino-acid conservation in their A/B regions.The A/B domains are intrinsically flexible as they were not observable in the crystal structure. These receptor portions are also not conserved in sequence. The intrinsic flexibility in this receptor portion of PPAR-γ was independently verified by H/D-Ex.Three distinct PPAR-c ligands did not substantially impact the ordering of the A/B regions.	pdb:3dzu, pdb:3dzy, pdb:3e00		The LBD can also have an important function in modulating DNA binding depending on the manner in which the complex is organized. The fuzzy A/B segment dynamically modulates the interactions between the two DBDs, which could provide selective gene modulation properties by imparting a graded set of response element affinities.

UvrD interacts with UvrB, a component of the post-incision complex. The absence of the C-terminal extension in UvrD<sub>1-647</sub> reduced the apparent affinity of the protein for single-stranded DNA. Deletion either 40 or 102 residues from the C-terminus of E. coli UvrD (creating UvrD&#916;40C and UvrD&#916;102C) weakened binding to single-stranded DNA-cellulose columns, but in filter binding assays only UvrD&#916;102C showed reduced affinity for single-stranded DNA. UvrD&#916;40C, lost the ability to dimerise, but was otherwise functional: it retained helicase activity and the ability to restore the UV-resistance of a strain lacking uvrD. In contrast UvrD&#916;102C lacked ATPase activity as well as DNA-binding ability.			Using 2-hybrid analysis and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy the N-terminal domain and the unstructured region at the C-terminus of UvrD was found to interact with UvrB. The truncated UvrD protein that lacked the unstructured C-terminal region showed a diminished affinity for single-stranded DNA, but retained the ability to displace both UvrC and the lesion-containing oligonucleotide from a post-incision nucleotide excision repair complex.	pdb:2is6		In Gram-positive organisms the roles of both UvrD and Rep are combined in a single essential helicase, PcrA, which can displace both UvrC and the damage-containing oligonucleotide from a post-incision NER complex.

Association of telomere protein subunits is DNA-dependent, and α-β association enhances DNA affinity. ITC measurements show that a significant portion of binding energy and heat capacity could be assigned to structural reorganization involving protein-protein interactions and repositioning of the DNA. Structural reorganization probably represents the driving force behind an allosteric switch that modulates DNA binding affinity and, importantly, DNA position.			Comparison of the full-length αβDNA co-crystal structure with the protease-resistant core domain of β showed that the protein-DNA interface is extremely well preserved. No additional electron density was apparent, confirming that the C-terminal tail of β is unstructured.

FC00058	P07674	Plasmid partition protein KorB	DNA	CD, AUC, SAXS, X-ray, NMR	253-293	The partitioning of DNA between daughter cells upon cell division is critical for the survival of all organisms. Partitioning in most bacteria is dependent on two proteins from the ParA/ParB families. ParB binds to a specific centromere- like sequence (parS) on the chromosome forming a higher order nucleoprotein complex that is thought to pair the sister chromosomes/plasmids. ParA, an ATPase, binds to ParB and is thought to act as a motor, pulling or pushing two ParB-bound chromosomes apart to different poles of the bacterial cell. One of the best characterized ParB proteins is KorB. KorB binds simultaneously with RNA polymerase at promoters and interacts with it to prevent open complex formation. KorB can act upstream or downstream of the promoters and also at a distance. At all promoters, KorB acts cooperatively with a second repressor, either KorA, TrbA, or KorC, forming a regulatory network that coordinates expression of the operons on the plasmid.The plasmid partition protein KorB has a dual role: it is essential for the correct segregation of the low copy number broad host range RK2 plasmid while also being an important regulator of transcription. KorB belongs to the ParB family of proteins, and partitioning in RK2 has been studied as a simplified model of bacterial chromosome segregation. The N-terminal region of KorB modulates DNA-binding strength and site selectivity, repression at a distance, as well as the localization of KorB in the cell. The region between the C-terminal domain and the central domain (residues 252-294) is implicated in several functions of KorB, including repression of transcription and cooperativity with other proteins.			KorB was reconstructed from the known crystal structures using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). The calculated an ensemble of conformation which the protein adopts in solution shows that the flexible linker region adopts a slightly more compact conformations rather than the full range of random conformers available. Flexibility is important for the protein&#39;s functional role in the cell enabling it to bind at different distances along DNA and to different binding partners.	pdb:1r71		Fuzziness enables binding to a diverse set of proteins resulting in cooperative effects or different target DNA sequences.

FC00062	P25963	iκBα	NFκB	NMR, H/D, smFRET	67-206, 276-287	IκBα binds and inhibits NFκB, an important transcription factor that regulates genes for cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, and stress responses. IκBα exerts tight control over the activity of NFκB. IκB kinase, Deletion of the PEST sequence (residues 276-287) reduces the NfκB binding by ~5 kcal/mol. The PEST region does not become completely ordered upon binding to NfκB according to high resolution NMR spectroscopy data. The native state of the NfκB-IκBα complex thus retains regions with high dynamic character.			In the absence of NFκB, ARs 5 and 6 of free IκBα have properties of an intrinsically disordered protein, while the rest of the protein (ARs 1 through 4) remains well folded. ARs 5 and 6 in free IκBα rapidly undergo amide hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange, but amide exchange is markedly decreased when IκBα is bound to NFκB, providing strong evidence that the AR 5-6 region folds on binding. The ankyrin repeat (AR) 1-4 fluctuations were still present in the NFκB-bound state. The nuclear localization sequence of NFκB lies over the top of AR 1 in IκBα, and this interaction provides nearly 8 kcal/mol of binding affinity in the complex. On the other hand, the crystallographic B-factors for this part of the NFκB-IκBα complex are very high, implying disorder in this region. The H/D exchange in AR 1 only slightly decreases (1-2 amides fewer) upon binding to NFκB.smFRET data demonstrated that although the major conformation of free IκBα resembles that of the NFκB-bound one, free IκBα undergoes heterogeneous fluctuations to a more extended structure on the millisecond time scale. smFRET results revealed that ARs 1 and 6 undergo fluctuations at room temperature, suggesting that detachment/unfolding of the end repeats is a general property of AR domains. AR1 fluctuation enables ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα and release NFκB for its nuclear translocation.	pdb:1nfi		Fuzziness is important for the ability of IκBα to promote the dissociation of NFκB from DNA transcription sites, as well as for establishing the rapid degradation rate of free IκBα and maintaining low intracellular IκBα levels.

The intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of N (N<sub>TAIL</sub>) is essential for transcription and replication of the virus via interaction with the phosphoprotein P of the viral polymerase complex. 		PhaSepDB:Q89933 region:1-525 region:1-525	The molecular recognition element (MoRE, 485-502) of NTAIL that binds P is situated 90 amino acids from the folded RNA-binding domain (N<sub>CORE</sub>) of N. Structural characterization of N<sub>TAIL</sub> in the context of the entire N-RNA capsid using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, small angle scattering, and electron microscopy, it was demonstrated that N<sub>TAIL</sub> is highly flexible in intact nucleocapsids and that the MoRE is in transient interaction with N<sub>CORE</sub>.Although the MoRE folds upon binding, the remainder of the 90 amino acid long N-terminal chain between the interaction site and N<sub>CORE</sub> remains flexible. Signals for the first 50 amino acids (residues 401-450) are absent, while large variations of peak intensities indicate differential flexibility along the remainder of the chain. Hence, the first 50 amino acids of N<sub>TAIL</sub> retain conformational disorder in the complex.			Fuzziness of N<sub>TAIL</sub> facilitates transient interactions between the MoRE and the capsid surface, which provides spatial constraints for polymerase interactions and also facilitates the access of the polymerase without major rearrangements of the nucleocapsid.

FC00064	P27958	Nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A)	Src homology 3 domain	NMR	200-228, 295-320	Nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is involved in a variety of viral and cellular processes. NS5A is indispensable for viral replication and particle assembly. The low-affinity NS5A binding sites were studied using a shorter NS5A construct, NS5A(191-340), that lacks the high-affinity SH3 binding site (PxxP motif) and a long construct NS5A(191-369). A global fit of the titration curves assuming a kinetic model with two independent binding sites, B1 and B2, yields a K<sup>1</sup><sub>d</sub> of 100 ± 50&#181;M for the B1 region and a K<sup>2</sup><sub>d</sub> of 240 ± 50 &#181;M for the B2 region. The B1 site has a 2-3-fold higher binding affinity for the Bin1-SH3 domain than the B2 site. Low- and high-affinity NS5A binding affects the same binding pocket on the surface of the SH3 domain.			NMR results reveal that in addition to the canonical SH3 binding to the PxxP motif, NS5A has two additional low-affinity binding sites for non-canonical SH3 binding, mainly through electrostatic interactions. Besides the interaction with SH3 domains mediated by a canonical PxxP motif located in the LCS-2 region of NS5A (binding site B3), two additional peptide regions (B1 and B2) were identified in NS5A that interact with the four SH3 domains mentioned above. Each SH3 domain can bind to only a single NS5A interaction site, and that the different binding modes are mutually exclusive as they all compete for the same binding pocket on the SH3 domain. Two low-affinity binding regions B1 and B2 partly overlap with peptide segments that were previously identified as having increased α-helical propensities. The population of α-helical structure decreases upon binding: the SSP scores in segment B1 are reduced to almost zero, while for B2, they are significantly reduced. The hetNOE values of NS5A residues in the binding regions decrease upon interaction with SH3, in agreement with a more flexible structural ensemble.	pdb:1r7e		The fuzzy nature of the complex adds an entropic contribution to the binding free energy that otherwise seems to be governed by electrostatic interactions between the positively charged residues of NS5A in the binding region and the negatively charged interaction surface of Bin1-SH3. The additional SH3 binding modes may be important for the regulation of molecular interaction and phosphorylation events that NS5A undergoes during the viral life cycle.

FC00065	Q67953	preS1 Hepatitis B virus	EAR domain of γ2-adaptin	NMR	11-44	Infectious HBV virions comprise an icosahedral nucleocapsid formed by the capsid-forming core protein HBc, within which the viral polymerase, genome and host proteins are encapsulated. Nucleocapsids are enveloped by three viral surface proteins: the small (S), middle (M) and large (L) surface proteins. L adopts two distinct orientations, i-preS L and e-preS L. In i-preS L, preS domains are cytoplasmically oriented and have essential roles in nucleocapsid envelopment. In e-preS L, preS domains are located within the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, eventually displaying preS1 on the exterior of the virion envelope, where it mediates infection via a cell-surface receptor (or receptors). PreS1 also regulates genome amplification after infection, has transactivation activity in host cells, regulates viral particle secretion and interacts with host chaperones to establish the dual topology of L. Yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation studies show i-preS L  interacts with γ2-adaptin but not with γ1-adaptin. Affinity with which preS1and preS1 (29-36) bound γ2-EAR was lower by a factor of ten than that of full-length preS1 (Kd~ 0.1 mM). ITC showed that binding of preS1(9-16), a Site 3 peptide, to 2-EAR was weaker by a factor of ~20 than that of full-length preS1.Deletions spanning preS1 Site 1, Site 3 or Site 5 impair HBV virion secretion and clearly ablate virus infectivity.			preS1 did not have substantial preformed secondary structure, and γ2-EAR binding did not induce further secondary structure formation. NOE enhancements, which probed fast, picosecond backbone dynamics, showed that residues 11-44 (encompassing Site 1, Site 2 and Site 3), though not as rigid as a folded protein, although were less dynamic than expected for an IDP. γ2-EAR-binding motifs and other regions of preS1 fall into discrete clusters flanked by proline residues with coherent dynamic properties.	pdb:3zhf		Albeit the motif-based interaction is weak it can be enhanced by the flanking fuzzy regions, which also enable the combinatorial usage of motifs.

FC00066	O89339	Nucleoprotein Ntail (N)	Phosphoprotein (P)	NMR, CD, EPR, ITC	464-473, 494-525	In paramyxoviruses, genome transcription and replication rely on the N-P interaction that is critical for the recruitment of the polymerase. This interaction makes the viral RNA accessible to the polymerase L through a structural reorganisation of the nucleocapsid. 			XD interacts only locally with the MoRE(473-492)  of N<sub>TAIL</sub> and that no additional residues are involved in the interaction. The NMR signal intensities outside the MoRE are not perturbed by the presence of XD. The similarity of the high-resolution NMR spectroscopic parameters measured in the presence and absence of the partner, which together represent the signature that the N-terminal part of N<sub>TAIL</sub> remains sterically hindered between turns of the nucleocapsid, indicates that there is no major reorganization of the nucleocapsid upon interaction.No new peaks appeared in the N<sub>TAIL</sub> spectrum even with saturating amounts of P<sub>XD</sub>. This suggests that even when bound to P<sub>XD</sub>, HeV N<sub>TAIL</sub> remains dynamic, undergoing exchange between different conformers on the P<sub>XD</sub> surface.Despite the α-helical transition that HeV N<sub>TAIL</sub> undergoes upon binding to P<sub>XD</sub>, the experimentally determined RS of the NiV N<sub>TAIL</sub>-P<sub>XD</sub> complex suggests that binding to P<sub>XD</sub> does not imply formation of a compact complex, instead it retains a considerable flexibility. In further support of this observation, the many observable and relatively sharp NMR resonances in HeV N<sub>TAIL</sub>-P<sub>XD</sub> complex, displaying chemical shifts that are nearly unaltered, provide evidence that N<sub>TAIL</sub> remains significantly disordered even in the bound form. Therefore the final complex is likely endowed with flexible appendages in a structural arrangement possibly reminiscent of that observed in the case of the MeV complex.			Fuzziness enables XD to be accommodated on N<sub>TAIL</sub> without triggering a nucleocapsid rearrangement that could increase the accessibility of the polymerase complex to the viral genome.

NiV N<sub>TAIL</sub> domains are disordered in the context of full-length nucleoproteins. P<sub>XD</sub> triggers an increase in the α-helical content of N<sub>TAIL</sub>. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, it was shown that P<sub>XD</sub> has no impact on the chemical environment of a Trp residue introduced at position 527 of the NiV N<sub>TAIL</sub> domain, thus arguing for the lack of stable contacts between the C termini of N<sub>TAIL</sub> and P<sub>XD</sub>.For both titrations, most resonances in the HSQC experienced no chemical shift changes, and only a few resonances underwent fast to intermediate exchange. P<sub>XD</sub> binds to N<sub>TAIL</sub> in close proximity of the α-MoRE predicted to encompass residues 473- 493 and is mediated by mostly hydrophobic contacts. Binding to P<sub>XD</sub> triggers a gain of α-helicity for at least eight residues. Despite the α-helical transition in NiV N<sub>TAIL</sub> undergo upon binding to P<sub>XD</sub>, the experimentally determined RS of the NiV N<sub>TAIL</sub>-P<sub>XD</sub> complex suggests that binding to P<sub>XD</sub> does not imply formation of a compact complex, with this latter rather retaining a considerable flexibility. In further support of this observation, the many observable and relatively sharp NMR resonances in NiV N<sub>TAIL</sub>-P<sub>XD</sub> complexes, displaying chemical shifts that are nearly unaltered, provide evidence that N<sub>TAIL</sub> remains significantly disordered even in the bound form. Therefore the final complex is likely endowed with flexible appendages in a structural arrangement possibly reminiscent of that observed in the case of the MeV complex.			Considering that the contact between P<sub>XD</sub> and N<sub>TAIL</sub> within the replicative complex has to be dynamically made/broken to allow the polymerase to progress along the nucleocapsid template during both transcription and replication. A fuzzy N<sub>TAIL</sub>-P<sub>XD</sub> complex can deliver N monomers to the nascent RNA chain and enables this transition to occur efficiently at a high rate.

FC00068	O95292	Vesicle associated membrane protein C (VAPC)	Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein NS5B	NMR	1-60, 63-72	The formation of the HCV replication machinery has been shown to require interactions of viral nonstructural NS5A/NS5B to host proteins including human vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (VAP) subtypes A and B. NS5A is a critical component of HCV replication, and is additionally involved in the modulation of cell signaling pathways, interferon response, pathogenesis, and apoptosis regulation. Although NS5B functions as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, it appears also to engage in protein-protein interactions critical for forming the replication machinery. VAPC, a splicing variant of VAPA/VAPB, was recently identified to block the HCV RNA replication as well as HCV propagation. VAPC was indeed capable of binding to NS5B with three discrete regions, with an average dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 20 mM.Site directed mutagenesis of four residues in second region demonstrates that they are critical for binding with NS5B. Kd value of VAPC-14 is 49.13 mM, only 3-fold larger than that for VAPC-43 (18.29 mM), suggesting that deletion of the first and third binding regions only resulted in a 3-fold reduction of the binding affinity to NS5B.		PhaSepDB:O95292	VAPC was characterized to be highly disordered in solution, only with helical-like conformations weakly populated over several segments. The HSQC spectral dispersions of VAPC did not significantly increase even upon binding to NS5B, implying that VAPC remained largely flexible even in the complex. Even at a molar ratio of 1:2.5, the HSQC spectral dispersions still remained largely unchanged. This implies that like the full-length VAPC, VAPC-43 also remains largely flexible without any tight tertiary packing in the complex with NS5B. The chemical shift differences indicate that, three discrete regions appears to be critical for binding with NS5B, i.e. the first one centered at Ile62, second over Arg73- Ala82, and third centered at Glu95.	pdb:2mdk		The fuzziness of the VAPC-NS5B complex results in discrete multi-binding site scenario for which the binding affinity of each separate site is relatively low, and also many residues are not significantly engaged in binding to NS5B and consequently remain flexible.

FC00069	Q04207	p65 (RelA)	CREB Binding Protein (CBP) TAZ1	NMR, ITC	425-439, 482-490	The interaction of the RelA subunit of NF-κB with the general co-activator protein CBP/p300 is vital for RelA-dependent gene transcription, which plays role in the immune response, cell survival, differentiation, and proliferation. The RelA-TAD:CBP-TAZ1 interaction was originaly mapped to RelA(477-504) region. Only a weak interaction between this RelA fragment and TAZ1 as compared to the whole RelA-TAD [RelA (425-549)] and therefore scanned the entire TAD for TAZ1 binding using GST pull-down assays. A RelA construct spanning residues Lys425-Pro490 (in the TA2 region) emerged as the minimal fragment with maximal affinity to TAZ1.Increasing the NaCl concentration from 50 to 150 mM weakened RelA-TA2:TAZ1 binding by 4-fold, consistent with a significant electrostatic contribution to binding from the complementary charges on TAZ1 and the RelA-TA2 region. The Leu449Ala and Leu465Ala substitutions each led to a 7-fold decrease in the TAZ1 binding affinity. RelA TA2 interacts with TAZ1 via multiple &psi;&psi;XX&psi;XX&psi; sequence motifs. N-terminal truncation to remove residues Lys425- His440, thereby eliminating the entire α<sub>N</sub> helix, decreases the affinity by only 1.6-fold.  Deletion of residues Ser486-Pro490 from the disordered C- terminal end of RelA had no effect on TAZ1 binding. However, further truncation to remove Val481-His485 greatly impaired binding by eliminating hydrophobic contacts. RelA residues beyond Val481 do not contribute to the interaction.			In the RelA-TA2:TAZ1 structure, the N- and C-terminal regions of the RelA-TA2 fragment used for structural analysis (Lys425-Thr433 and Ser482-Pro490, respectively) are dynamically disordered, with zero or negative [<sup>1</sup>H]-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear NOEs. RelA-TA2, essentially the Leu434-Val481 region, entirely wraps around TAZ1 in a predominantly extended conformation by docking itself through its well-conserved bulky hydrophobic residues into the interlinked hydrophobic grooves of TAZ1. The C-terminal region (Glu471-Asn477) of RelA-TA2 folds into one short helix α<sub>c</sub> that is anchored to the hydrophobic pocket of TAZ1.The N-terminal region (Leu434-Leu439) of RelA-TA2 also forms a short helix α<sub>N</sub>, which is docked into the shallow hydrophobic groove formed at the junction of α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>4</sub> of TAZ1. The α<sub>N</sub> helix is dynamically disordered with only about 30% of the helical population, as calculated from the magnitude of the C- alpha and carbonyl secondary chemical shifts, and the small value of the [<sup>1</sup>H]-<sup>15</sup>N heteronuclear NOE confirms that this region is highly flexible on the nanosecond time scale.	pdb:2lww	bmrb:18650	Fuzziness of the RelA TA2-TAZ1 complex exerts dynamic control of RelA-CBP/p300 interactions, which enables transcription of a series of NF-κB target genes independent of RelA(Ser276) phosphorylation.

FC00070	P06748	Nucleophosmin (NPM1)	DNA G-quadruplex c-Myc promoter	SPR	225-242	Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, mainly localized at nucleoli, that plays a number of functions in ribosome biogenesis and export, cell cycle control, and response to stress stimuli. The c-MYC-derived oligo Pu24I is recognized with different affinities by NPM1 C-terminal constructs differing for the presence of an unstructured flanking tail. 225-294 segment has a K<sub>D</sub> of 11&#181;M, while that of the 243-294 segment is 102 &#181;M. The region differentiating the two constructs (residues 225-242) is completely unstructured and this fuzzy region remains unstructured after binding. Two concomitant Lys to Ala substitutions (Lys<sup>229</sup>-Lys<sup>230</sup>) in the unstructured segment of NPM1-C70 result in a dramatic decrease of global affinity.	Involved in diverse cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis, centrosome duplication, protein chaperoning, histone assembly, cell proliferation, and regulation of tumor suppressors p53/TP53 and ARF.NPM1 contains an N-terminal oligomerization domain (OD) which has been shown to be necessary to form an ordered pentameric structure, a central disordered domain containing acidic tracts (A2/A3), and a C-terminal RNA binding domain (RRM). The OD of NPM1 can form a pentamer to generate multivalency and could potentially increase the affinity of its RRM domain for rRNA.NPM1 is a multivalent protein containing three acidic LCD tracts permitting interaction with many nucleolar binding partners with multivalent arginine-rich motifs (R-motifs).

FC00071	Q5VZK9	Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 16A (LRRC16A)	Actin capping protein (CP)	X-ray	1005-1020	The capping protein (CP) ARp2/3 myosin I linker (CARMIL) is a multifunctional actin regulator. The minimal peptide, which shows both CP sequestration and uncapping activities and is referred to henceforth as the CP interaction (CPI) motif. The construct containing peptide sequences, which flank the CPI motif, leading to stronger uncapping activity. The CPI motif from CARMIL (971-1004) binds CP (K<sub>d</sub> ~ 0.1-0.2 &#181;M), while the larger, 964-1078 segment has K<sub>D</sub> ~ 1.5 nM and higher uncapping and sequestration activities.			The binding position for the CPI motif is distant to the actin binding interface. The structure reveals two ordered CARMIL regions: the CPI motif, Ile971-Cys1004, and Arg1021-Thr1035, which binds to the under-side of the CP mushroom cap on the opposite side of the CP mushroom stalk to which the CPI motif binds. This region appears not to be present in other CPI-motif proteins from sequence analyses and is termed the CARMIL-specific interaction (CSI) motif. The linker between the two ordered region is disordered in the sequence. The extended nature of the CARMIL CPI and CSI motifs leads to multiple interactions with CP. The disordered residues between the CPI and CSI motifs may be sufficient in length to reach toward the actin binding site on the topside of the CP mushroom cap.	pdb:3lk3		Fuzzy regions serve as allosteric modulators to suppress conformational dynamics of CP and restrict to low-affinity filament bound conformation. Capping activity of CP is fine- tuned for the highly orchestrated assembly of the cellular actin machinery, and the conformational flexibility of CP provides the structural basis for the regulation.

FC00072	Q13542	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E -binding protein 2 (4E-BP2)	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)	NMR, SAXS, ITC	1-53, 61-77, 83-120	Cap-dependent translation initiation is regulated by the interaction of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BPs). The 4E-BPs play essential roles in development and cell growth in all cell types and, in neurons, 4E-BP2 is critical for synaptic plasticity, learning and memory formation. Out of the three 4E-BP isoforms 4E-BP2 exhibits the highest affinity for eIF4E.4E-BP2 contains significant fluctuating secondary structure and binds eIF4E at an extensive bipartite interface including the canonical <sup>54</sup>YXXXXLΦ<sup>60</sup> and <sup>78</sup>IPGVT<sup>82</sup> sites. Each of the two binding elements individually has submicromolar affinity and exchange on and off of the eIF4E surface within the context of the overall nanomolar complex. Systematic deletion mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance to demonstrate that the residues C-terminal to the canonical binding site contribute significantly to binding with the affinity of full-length 4E-BPs being approximately two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of the peptides.The KD value for eIF4E binding to wild-type 4E-BP2 is 3.2 ± 0.6 nM. The <sup>78</sup>IPGVT<sup>82</sup> segment undergoes more conformational fluctuations within the bound state than the canonical site. Interactions involving both sites are synergistic, with a low nanomolar KD, since isolated canonical site peptides bind in the micromolar range. The binding of the canonical site is enthalpically driven, whereas interaction of the secondary binding site is driven by entropy, suggesting that this second site is highly dynamic in the complex. The dynamic nature of 4E-BP2 was observed in complexes with both cap-free and cap-bound eIF4E.	Repressor of translation initiation involved in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory formation. Regulates EIF4E activity by preventing its assembly into the eIF4F complex: hypophosphorylated form of EIF4EBP2 competes with EIF4G1/EIF4G3 and strongly binds to EIF4E, leading to repress translation. In contrast, hyperphosphorylated form dissociates from EIF4E, allowing interaction between EIF4G1/EIF4G3 and EIF4E, leading to initiation of translation. EIF4EBP2 is enriched in brain and acts as a regulator of synapse activity and neuronal stem cell renewal via its ability to repress translation initiation. Mediates the regulation of protein translation by hormones, growth factors and other stimuli that signal through the MAP kinase and mTORC1 pathways.	LLPSDB:p0271	4E-BP2 possesses significant transient secondary structure throughout the protein with a high helical propensity in the canonical binding site. Five regions, M1-A5, D33-T37, T50-N64, T86-E89, and N96-D105, have helical propensities greater than 0.15. 4E-BP2 binds to eIF4E using a bipartite mode of interaction involving residues spanning from immediately N-terminal to the canonical binding site to beyond the highly conserved <sup>78</sup>IPGVT<sup>82</sup> sequence. Interestingly, mutating <sup>78</sup>IPGVT<sup>82</sup>, but not <sup>54</sup>YXXXXLΦ<sup>60</sup>, significantly changes the dynamics of the complex such that some previously invisible resonances of the bound state can be observed. Significant resonance broadening on the surface of eIF4E and chemical shift changes throughout eIF4E, demonstrating extensive allosteric effects of 4E-BP binding. The loss of bound resonances within the interaction interface likely originates from broadening due to microsecond to millisecond conformational exchange within the complex. In the complex with wild-type 4E- BP2, the secondary binding site is more dynamic than the canonical site. The regions of 4E-BP2 outside the binding interface maintain their intrinsically disordered nature, with &#39;flanking fuzziness&#39; and T19-A28 even more flexible in the bound state.	pdb:3am7	bmrb:19114	Fuzziness enables long-range allosteric effects, which causes allosteric enhancement of eIF4E mRNA cap binding. Fuzziness also facilitates the regulation of translation initiation through posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation by high frequency exposure of target sites to kinases and other enzymes.

FC00073	Q9VMA3	Cup	eIF4E	X-ray	340-361, 1-317, 377-1117	Cup is an eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) that plays a central role in translational regulation of localized mRNAs during early Drosophila development. In particular, Cup is required for repressing translation of the mRNAs, which are essential for embryonic body axis determination. Cup is involved in repressing at least three localized and developmentally essential mRNAs in Drosophila&#151;oskar, nanos, and gurken&#151;and might function as a general repressor for many as-yet-unknown mRNAs. Cup 4E-BS II has a role in stabilizing the mRNA (by preventing decapping) and simultaneously blocking eIF4G recruitment. Two separate segments of Cup contact two orthogonal faces of eIF4E. The eIF4E-binding consensus motif of Cup (YXXXXLΦ) binds the convex side of eIF4E similarly to the consensus of other eIF4E-binding proteins, such as 4E-BPs and eIF4G. The second, non-canonical, eIF4E-binding site of Cup binds laterally and perpendicularly to the eIF4E β-sheet. Mutations of Cup at this binding site were shown to reduce binding to eIF4E and to promote the destabilization of the associated mRNA.			Cup interacts with eIF4E as two short α-helices connected by a linker that is disordered in the structure. Other portions of the proteins are not present in the structure and are either poorly ordered or were removed during proteolysis. The two stretches, of 35 residues in total, bury 1.2% (350 &Aring;<sup>2</sup>) of the solvent-accessible surface area of the eIF4E. The N-terminal segment of Cup that is visible in the electron density map includes the eIF4E consensus motif and docks at the convex surface of eIF4E, where it contacts part of the unstructured N terminus of the protein. After a disordered linker of about 20 residues, Cup extends laterally on eIF4E, where a few, mainly hydrophobic, interactions create surface distinct from the 4E-consensus binding site. Both binding sites of Cup are situated away from the m<sup>7</sup>G cap- binding pocket. The binding site I of Cup docks at the convex dorsal surface of eIF4E similarly to the previously described eIF4G and 4E-BPs peptides. Consensus residues (common to 4G and 4E-BP) make similar contacts with several invariant eIF4E side chains found in the helices α1 and α 2 and also with the N-terminal extension of eIF4E. Binding site II of Cup docks laterally with a helix (α 2) that lies antiparallel to the outer β-strand (β2) of eIF4E and a turn that points upward toward the convex surface of eIF4E. Although most of the intermolecular contacts between eIF4E and Cup are conserved, some interactions involve residues that are uniquely conserved in insects. The lateral binding site on eIF4E could be generally exploited by diverse eIF4E-binding proteins.	pdb:4axg		Multivalent binding, enabled by the fuzzy linker, contributes significantly to eIF4E stabilization and consequently facilitate preventing the degradation of the mRNA. It is possible that the second, lateral binding site would initiate competition and strengthen the affinity for the mRNA.

FC00074	P01106	c-Myc	Bin1 SH3 domain	NMR, SPR	1-88	The c-Myc oncoprotein (Myc) is a transcription factor that regulates a wealth of genes involved in a wide-variety of biological activities including apoptosis, differentiation as well as proliferation. As a critical regulator of both normal and tumor cells,Myc is highly controlled at many levels and is at the center of an extensive interactome.

Bin1 binding could retain Myc in its S62-unphosphorylated, inactive state, which is indirectly supported by liberated Myc cell proliferative activity when Bin1 expression is inhibited by the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein.

Binding of Bin1 to Myc-1-88 as assayed by NMR and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed primary binding to the S62 region in a dynamically disordered and multivalent complex, accompanied by population shifts leading to altered intramolecular conformational dynamics. Dynamic properties of Myc-1-88 on a rapid time scale (ps-ns) were studied in the absence and presence of ligand binding. Binding maintains overall intrinsic disorder in Myc-1-88 with no large-scale evidence for stable structure in the complex. Residues in the more flexible middle and C-terminal region show very minor or insignificant differences between bound and free forms. For residues 1-30, 49-56 and 61-82 in the transiently ordered segments of the bound form compared to the free state suggest that fewer long-range interactions are sampled by these regions in the conformational ensemble of the disordered protein domain.	pdb:1mv0		Fuzziness and complex dynamics in Myc together with multivalent interactions within Myc-1-88 and between Myc-1-88 and Bin1-SH3 may be critical for achieving rapid yet accurate response to cellular signals in gene regulation.

FC00075	P06454	Prothymosin α (ProT α)	Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), Kelch domain	NMR, ITC	1-29, 60-111	Prothymosin α (ProTα), an intrinsically disordered protein, also interacts with the Kelch domain of Keap1 and mediates the import of Keap1 into the nucleus to inhibit Nrf2 activity. Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) is an inhibitor of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor for cytoprotective gene activation in the oxidative stress response. Under unstressed conditions, Keap1 interacts with Nrf2 in the cytoplasm via its Kelch domain and suppresses the transcriptional activity of Nrf2. During oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1 and is translocated into the nucleus, where it interacts with the small Maf protein to initiate gene transcription. To evaluate the contributions of ProTα residues distant from the Kelch-binding motif to the affinity of binding, the affinity of Kelch to the full-length ProTα and an 11-mer peptide spanning residues 38- 48 were compared. The dissociation constant of the full-length ProTα- Kelch complex was determined to be 2.6 ± 0.4 &#181;M by ITC. The 11-mer ProTα peptide bound slightly tighter (K<sub>d</sub> = 1.79 ± 0.09 &#181;M) to Kelch compared to full-length ProTα. Despite the similar K<sub>d</sub> values, the &#916;H and &#916;S of these two binding processes were very different. The results indicate a larger entropy loss when the ProTα peptide bound to Kelch. The more negative &#916;S value was compensated for by the more favorable &#916;H, resulting in similar K<sub>d</sub> values for both full-length ProTα and its peptide.			Nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift mapping, amide hydrogen exchange, and spin relaxation measurements revealed that ProTα retains a high level of flexibility, even in the bound state with Kelch. In the bound state, amino acids in the region 35-53 had SSP scores ranging only from -0.34 to 0.17, indicating a lack of stable secondary structure in this region. No dramatic increases in protection factor values were observed upon addition of Kelch. Even though moderate increases in protection factor values for N38, E45, N50, and G60 were observed, these values were significantly smaller than those observed in folded proteins. The disordered nature of the ProTα-Kelch complex is also supported by the observations that the resonance signals of ProTα in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC experiments were clustered in a narrow range from 7.9 ppm to 8.6 ppm, both in the free and bound states. Significant chemical shift changes were observed only for amino acids 35-50. In the Kelch complex the NOE values of ProTα remained predominantly negative upon binding to Kelch, indicative of a flexible protein lacking secondary structure.	pdb:2z32		Fuzziness of the ProTα - Keap1 complex enables ProTα to interact with other targets simultaneously. In addition, the fuzzy complex formed allows ProTα to quickly dissociate from Keap1 after the latter is translocated into the nucleus.

FC00076	Q60795	NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)	Keap1	X-ray, ITC	41-51	Transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) plays important roles in the cellular defense against various electrophilic and oxidative stresses. Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) negatively controls Nrf2 signaling. Nrf2 coordinately regulates cytoprotective gene expression, but under unstressed conditions, Nrf2 is degraded rapidly through Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1)-mediated ubiquitination. Nrf2 is rapidly ubiquitinated by Keap1-Cul3 (Cullin 3) E3 ligase. The DLG motif is much longer than the previously defined &#39;classical&#39; DLG motif; thus, it is also referred as the extended DLG motif as the DLGex motif, which contains both the classical DLG motif and the DIDLID element. Deletion analysis shows that region spanning Met17 to Tyr46 is essential and sufficient for Keap1 binding. Met17 to Gln51 retains slightly stronger Keap1- binding activity. Met17 to Gln51 as the extended DLG motif of Nrf2 (Nrf2-DLGex). The DLGex peptide generates 14 potential intermolecular electrostatic interactions between Keap1 and the DC domain. (k<sub>a</sub> was 6.1 x 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and dissociation rate constant (k<sub>d</sub> was 0.196 s<sup>-1</sup>), it is concluded that the binding of Nrf2-DLGex to Keap1-DC has fast association and dissociation modes.Nrf2 harbors two Keap1-binding motifs, DLG and ETGE. Interactions between these two motifs and Keap1 constitute a key regulatory nexus for cellular Nrf2 activity through the formation of a two-site binding hinge-and-latch mechanism. DLG motif is the low-affinity latch site, Keap1-DLGex binding is characterized as enthalpy and entropy driven, while Keap1-ETGE binding is characterized as purely enthalpy driven. DLGex binding to Keap1 is distinct from that of ETGE structurally, thermodynamically, and kinetically. The DLGex motif serves as a converter transmitting environmental stress to Nrf2 induction as the latch site.

FC00077	Q61548	AP180	Clathrin	NMR, AUC	623-680	Clathrin-mediated vesicular trafficking begins on the membrane, when clathrin assembly/adaptor proteins such as AP2 and AP180 are cooperatively recruited via interactions with the phosphoinositide PIP<sub>2</sub> (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) and with membrane-bound cargo molecules. The nascent complex in turn recruits cytosolic clathrin and nucleates the formation of a clathrin-coated pit.  As the coated pit grows, additional accessory proteins that promote membrane scission are recruited, allowing clathrin-coated vesicles to detach from the membrane. The clathrin-coated vesicles are then rapidly uncoated via a chaperone-mediated reaction that returns the coat proteins to the cytosol, and the liberated transport vesicles then deliver their cargo molecules to an appropriate subcellular compartment by membrane fusion. While AP180 M5 is predominantly disordered, the two clathrin binding sites contain limited but persistent β-turn-like structure in both the free and the bound states. Binding of clathrin TD to each site is relatively weak, with K<sub>d</sub> values in the &Tilde;2&#215;10<sup>-4</sup> M range. Each site in the two-site AP180 M5 molecule binds a different clathrin TD. AUC suggests that both sites interact simultaneously with a single clathrin TD to enhance the affinity (by 1.5 fold) of the two-site AP180 M5.Dissociation rate constants are in the range of 2 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> to 4 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and association rate constants are in the range of 1&#215;10<sup>7</sup> to 2&#215;10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> These are among the fastest association rates that have ever been measured for a protein-protein interaction.		PhaSepDB:Q61548	Mutational, NMR chemical shift, and analytical ultracentrifugation analyses of the interaction between clathrin and a large fragment of the CBD (Clathrin binding domain) of the clathrin assembly protein AP180 defined two clathrin binding sites within this fragment, each of which is found to bind weakly to the N-terminal domain of the clathrin heavy chain (TD). The AP180 fragment is similarly unstructured in its bound and free states, with localized β-turn-like structures at the two clathrin binding sites both when free and when bound to clathrin. Weak binding by multiple, pre-structured clathrin binding elements regularly dispersed throughout a largely unstructured CBD allows efficient recruitment of clathrin to endocytic sites and dynamic assembly of the clathrin lattice.AP180 M5 revealed that AP180 M5 is predominantly unstructured in solution, in both the free and the clathrin-TD-bound states. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (1) All of the peaks representing the backbone of AP180 M5 are located within the region corresponding to backbone amide <sup>1</sup> H chemical shifts from 7.9 to 8.5 ppm in both free and bound states (2) Secondary chemical shift analysis did not reveal patterns associated with α helices or β sheets in either state (3) NOESY experiments did not reveal any <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>1</sup>H NOEs that would indicate the presence of α helices or β sheets in AP180 M5 either when free in solution or when bound to TD. (4) <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H NOEs throughout the polypeptide chain are negative in both free and bound states, further indicating a lack of extensive secondary structure in AP180 M5.HSQC spectra in both the free and the bound forms indicates that binding is not associated with extensive folding of this fragment. Frictional coefficients measured by AUC closer to that of a fully unfolded polypeptide.			Fuzziness enables a weak binding mode when multiple, pre-structured clathrin binding elements regularly dispersed throughout a largely unstructured CBD allow efficient recruitment of clathrin to endocytic sites and dynamic assembly of the clathrin lattice.This multivalent binding concentrates clathrin at a specific site without inhibiting the motions that allow the clathrin triskelia to establish the interactions that determine the final stability and geometry of the clathrin coat.

FC00078	Q7YUB9	Anhydrin	DNA	NMR, FTIR, CD	1-86	Anhydrin&#39;s gene is induced in response to dehydration in the anhydrobiotic nematode, Aphelenchus avenae. Anhydrin is entirely intrinsically disordered yet possesses two apparently independent functions: a chaperone-like molecular shield, which is able to reduce aggregation of client proteins in vitro and in the nucleus, and a novel endonuclease. With increasing concentration of anhydrin, the supercoiled (SC) form of the plasmid gradually disappeared, being replaced by open-circular (OC) plasmid and an additional band that migrated between them, which was later confirmed to be a linearized plasmid. Anhydrin also cleaves the plasmids pHM6 and pET28a+ showing that it recognizes a range of substrates, including linear DNA. The pattern of anhydrin endonuclease activity was compared with that of various known DNA modifying enzymes, but the profiles were not identical indicating a different mechanism of digestion. So anhydrin convert supercoiled plasmid DNA to linear form, probably via a nicked, open circle, and to digest linear DNA to small fragments; it also cleaves linker DNA in chromatin.			Interaction between anhydrin and supercoiled plasmid DNA, pcDNA3.1 was tested by NMR. 1D <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum indicated binding of a significant proportion of anhydrin molecules to the plasmid which, because of its size, has slow diffusion properties leading to broadening of amide resonances in the complexed protein so they are no longer detected. NMR experiments indicate binding of anhydrin to DNA, both CD and FTIR analysis showed no increase in folding in the presence of DNA and thus anhydrin remains disordered.			Nuclease function for anhydrin would be of value in anhydrobiosis where desiccation is expected to cause DNA breakage, tangling, and stalled replication forks, resulting in structures that require resolution, repair, or removal during the rehydration phase. An alternative role might be in apoptosis or necrosis, where DNA breakdown is required. The precise structural role of fuzziness in making a dynamic assembly with DNA is unknown.

Anhydrin, whose gene is induced in response to dehydration in the anhydrobiotic nematode, Aphelenchus avenae and does not belong to the embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins. The enzyme citrate synthase (CS) was dried in the presence of anhydrin, a significant decrease in aggregation was observed. In the nucleus nuclear polyadenine binding protein with 17 consecutive alanine residues (EGFP-PABPN1-A17) was used to test for antiaggregation activity and supported a protein antiaggregation role for anhydrin in vivo.Coimmunoprecipitation suggests that this association is not strong, it is possible that anhydrin interacts more loosely with its targets.			Evidence from in vivo FRET experiments for a degree of association between anhydrin and PABPN1-A17 consistent with weak and/or short-lived complex formation. This indicates that anhydrin does not function exclusively as an entropic chain, by a volume exclusion effect, but rather can interact loosely with client proteins to provide an electrostatic and/or steric obstacle to close approach of other aggregating species.Aggregation reducing activity may result from electrosteric interference where the IDP reduces the encounter frequency of aggregating protein species, termed as molecular shield activity.			Fuzziness and dynamic assembly of anhydrin with its clients could provide electrostatic shielding and prevent aggregation. It can also help dissociation from the partner.

Emerging evidence suggests that the functional diversity of the dynein complex is in part due to an array of accessory regulatory proteins that are not stoichiometric components of the dynein complex. K<sub>D</sub> for IC 1-40 (primary binding region) is 1.7 &#181;M, IC 1-87 is 2.5 &#181;M, IC1-143 2.2 &#181;M, suggesting a slight competition with intermolecular interactions when region 2 is present.Modifications in region 2 regulate p150<sup>Glued</sup> binding.			Specific residues within IC that interact with NudE are a subset of the bi-segmental binding region, preferably region 1 of the bi-segmental binding.NudE-bound IC has increased flexibility on the faster time scale in region 2, evidenced by lower heteronuclear NOE values relative to apo-IC.In the nNudE-bound protein, residues 41- 47 and 62- 87 become slightly more ordered, whereas residues 48 - 61 become slightly more disordered. These data suggest that the nascent helix observed in this region in the unbound IC is not stabilized upon binding but on the contrary becomes slightly more disordered.			Fuzziness enables a bi-segmental binding region of IC as well as in region 2 and flanking linkers it plays a role in selecting which regulatory protein binds IC.

FC00082	P0DP23	Calmodulin	Myelin basic protein (MBP) 145-165	NMR, ITC	73-85	Myelin basic protein (MBP) is a predominant protein in the multilamellar arrangement of the myelin sheath in the central nervous system. The myelin sheath has a dynamic structure that enables rapid signal propagation in the nervous system. This dynamic nature can be envisaged as the continuous formation and disruption of interactions in its protein content. Interactions of MBP can be modulated by with calcium(II) bound calmodulin (CaM). The binding site with the highest affinity to the MBP peptide is characterized by a dissociation constant (K<sub>D</sub>) of 8.3 ± 0.1 &#181;M, which is in good agreement with the one calculated from NMR spectroscopy. The affinities of the other two sites do not differ dramatically, being 11.8 ± 0.7 &#181;M and 10.4 ± 0.1 &#181;M.ITC measurements indicate three sets of binding sites, with the binding affinity being in the range 11.8 ± 0.7 &#181;M to 8.3 ± 0.1 &#181;M suggesting that the CaM-MBP<sub>145-165</sub> interaction might sample different conformations. MBP<sub>145-165</sub> affects the CaM protein conformational ensemble.		PhaSepDB:P62158	MBP<sub>145-165</sub> affects the CaM protein conformational ensemble. CaM can adopt a large ensemble of conformations while in complex with the MBP<sub>145-165</sub>.The structural heterogeneity revealed in the MBP<sub>145-165</sub>-CaM complex could be a prerequisite for recognition pliability both for CaM and the MBP epitope.MOs of multiple conformations sampled by this complex were determined on the basis of simultaneous use of paramagnetic pcs and rdc restraints. The complex CaM-MBP<sub>145-165</sub> confers conformational heterogeneity, which differs from other CaM complexes.			The presence of heterogeneity, i.e. fuzziness in the MBP-calmodulin complexes provides the plasticity necessary to interact with a large number of different targets and enables the relevant recognition plasticity to take place.

FC00083	P03255	Adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) oncoprotein	CBP TAZ2 domain, Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein	NMR, ITC smFRET	82-121	E1A deregulates the cell cycle through interactions with key cellular proteins, including the general transcriptional coactivators cyclic-AMP response element binding (CREB) binding protein (CBP) and p300 and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), which lead to epigenetic modifications and reprogramming of host cell transcriptional processes. Binding of E1A to pRb displaces the E2F transcription factors, thereby relieving E2F repression and resulting in premature S-phase entry and transcriptional activation of E2F-regulated genes. Interactions between E1A and CBP/p300 are central to its ability to transform cells and induce mitosis. E1A represses CBP/ p300-dependent transcriptional activity by binding to promoter-bound CBP/p300. E1A inhibits p53-mediated activation of p21 and other stress response genes and thereby suppresses cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. E1A has been variously reported to inhibit and to activate the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of CBP/p300. The relative independence of the two E1A binding sites is represented by several lines of data. Either site alone is able to induce G<sub>1</sub> gene expression and DNA synthesis in primary rodent cells. Nevertheless, unless both E1A active sites are present, these cell cycle effects are incomplete and the stimulated cells do not go on to divide successfully. For example E1A transforming activity is about 10-fold more efficient when the two active sites are present on the same molecule. Conservation of a spacer region within E1A correlates with the requirement for simultaneous occupation of both binding sites. A non-conserved stretch of about 35 residues that is not required for efficient binding at either of the two protein binding sites in the E1A products. The spacer region is indeed required for stable simultaneous binding of pRB-related proteins and p300. E1A lacking the 86-120 region binds to both target proteins, but not readily in the same complexes, such that the pRB- related proteins are not brought together stably with p300. Furthermore, immortalization activity of E1A depends not on passive sequestering of these cellular targets but on actively promoting an association between them. smFRET shows that E1A-CBP-pRb interactions have either positive or negative cooperativity, depending on the available E1A interaction sites.			A model of the pRb:E1A:TAZ2 ternary complex was constructed from structures of the pRb pocket domain in complex with residues 37-49 from the E1A CR1 region and with the LXCXE motif from human papilloma virus (HPV) E7, together with the NMR structure. Residues 37-49 of E1A bind in a deep groove at the interface of the A and B cyclin fold domains of pRb, while residues 53-91 in the C-terminal half of CR1 interact with the TAZ2 domain of CBP/p300. Residues 92-120 of E1A are invisible between the TAZ2 binding site in CR1 and the LXCXE motif (residues 122-126) in CR2. The CR1-CR2 linker must be long enough to allow simultaneous binding of CR1 and CR2 in their cognate sites on pRb and to accommodate binding of CBP/p300 without creating steric clashes. CR1 and CR2 are connected by a long (~30 residues) intrinsically disordered linker in all sequenced E1A serotypes.	pdb:2kje		The fuzzy linker enables allosteric coupling between the two binding regions thus permitting a context-specific tuning of the associated downstream signaling outputs.

FC00084	P04637	p53 TAD	Nuclear Coactivator Binding domains (NCBD) of CBP	NMR	27-39	The p53 tumor suppressor acts as a hub in signal transduction networks that mediate the cellular response to stress, leading to cell-cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis. Owing to its role in determining cell fate, p53 is tightly controlled by numerous regulatory proteins that include MDM2, MDMX, CBP/p300, and various kinases. The affinity of full p53 TAD is 1.7 &#181;M. While binding is dominated by the AD2 motif (K<sub>d</sub> = 5-14 &#181;M for peptides containing only AD2, compared to K<sub>D</sub> > 300 &#181;M for the isolated AD1 peptide), both AD1 and AD2 contribute to the overall affinity for binding to the NCBD.	Acts as a tumor suppressor in many tumor types; induces growth arrest or apoptosis depending on the physiological circumstances and cell type. Involved in cell cycle regulation as a trans-activator that acts to negatively regulate cell division by controlling a set of genes required for this process. One of the activated genes is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. Apoptosis induction seems to be mediated either by stimulation of BAX and FAS antigen expression, or by repression of Bcl-2 expression. In cooperation with mitochondrial PPIF is involved in activating oxidative stress-induced necrosis; the function is largely independent of transcription. Induces the transcription of long intergenic non-coding RNA p21 (lincRNA-p21) and lincRNA-Mkln1. LincRNA-p21 participates in TP53-dependent transcriptional repression leading to apoptosis and seems to have an effect on cell-cycle regulation. Implicated in Notch signaling cross-over. Prevents CDK7 kinase activity when associated to CAK complex in response to DNA damage, thus stopping cell cycle progression. Isoform 2 enhances the transactivation activity of isoform 1 from some but not all TP53-inducible promoters. Isoform 4 suppresses transactivation activity and impairs growth suppression mediated by isoform 1. Isoform 7 inhibits isoform 1-mediated apoptosis. Regulates the circadian clock by repressing CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activation of PER2	PhaSepDB:P04637, LLPSDB:p0208	Upon binding to CBP p53 TAD folds into two helices: which extend from Phe19 to Leu25 and Pro47 to Trp53, whereas residues in between remain disordered in the complex, as indicated in shifts of the <sup>13</sup>C resonances. residues around 27-39, which form a long loop between the Pα1 and Pα2 helices, are disordered in the structure ensemble in accord with their small heteronuclear NOEs sharp resonances, and the lack of intermolecular NOEs for these residues. Residue 27-39 loop of p53 wraps around helix Cα3 of the NCBD but appears to form no persistent contacts since it gives rise to no detectable intermolecular NOEs. The total buried hydrophobic surface area is 880 &Aring;<sup>2</sup>, of which 580 &Aring;<sup>2</sup> is contributed by helix Pα2 and the neighboring residues 40-45. The hydrophobic residues in AD2 (M40, L43, M44, L45, I50, W53, and F54) are directly involved in interactions with the NCBD, in the deep groove formed between helices Cα1-Cα2 and helix Cα3. Residues 40-45 appear to be less well ordered and have a smaller heteronuclear NOE than residues in helices Pα1 and Pα2, but this region of the p53 backbone exhibits a tendency towards a distorted helical conformation in the ensemble of p53:NCBD structures. F19, W23, and L26 in AD1 region also interact with the hydrophobic surface formed between helices Cα1 and Cα3. The hydrophobic residues in AD1 and AD2 are synergistically involved in the binding to the NCBD. These data are fully consistent with the structure of the p53 TAD:NCBD complex, where both AD1 and AD2 simultaneously interact with the NCBD domain. 13 residues between AD1 and AD2 remain disordered in the bound form.	pdb:2l14	bmrb:17073	Fuzziness enables simultaneous binding of the AD1 and AD2 motifs to the target protein. The presence of two interaction motifs in the intrinsically disordered TAD imparts the flexibility to form ternary complexes with MDM2 and CBP/p300 domains, or to bind with enhanced affinity through clamp-like interactions with the NCBD or other CBP/ p300 domains.

Lig proteins are categorized as microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules due to their ability to bind to eukaryotic cells through their interactions with extracellular matrix components. The high-affinity binding region for Fn NTD was assigned to the 47 amino acids of the non-repeat region (LigBCen2NR) of LigB. K<sub>D</sub> is 379 nM. Adding the folded regions increases affinity by 4-fold (93 nM). The non-repeat region is disordered in solution as it was demonstrated by various techniques: CD, NMR, DSL, Viscosity measurements, gel permeation chromatography. Binding of NTD to LigB decreases the propensity of random coils from 65% to 46%, and concomitantly increases the fraction of β-sheets (28 to 48%). Nevertheless, there is a significant fraction of disordered residues.k<sub>on</sub> 2.28x10<sup>5</sup> k<sub>off</sub>  2.47x10<sup>-2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>,  ITC measurements: &#916;H 13.13 kcal/mol, T&#916;S 22.25 kcal/mol, &#916;G 9.12 kcal/mol. The favorable entropy suggests that the complex formation of LigBCen2 and NTD involves significant hydrophobic interactions.			In <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum the part corresponding to the folded region remains unperturbed upon NTD interactions, whereas most sharp and clustered peaks disappear or decrease intensity. The nature and number of peaks that are affected by the addition of NTD suggest that NTD specifically binds to LigBCen2NR and results in chemical exchange in the intermediate rate regime, where the peaks whose chemical environment changes between conformational states are broadened beyond the level of detection. Based on SPR measurements, the line broadening observed for the NMR sample is not due to exchange between free and bound states. One possible explanation is the formation of a &#39;fuzzy complex&#39;, or a dynamic ensemble of conformational states, upon binding NTD, similarly to SfbI.			Fuzziness imparts moderate affinity and slow kinetics on the LigBCen2NR interaction with the NTD of Fn, which might aid in Leptospira infection of a host organism by increasing the time it remains adhered to cells while simultaneously facilitating efficient transmission within the host.

FC00086	P38936	p21<sup>Cip1</sup> cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>)	Cdk2/cyclin	NMR	27-48	p21 is a universal inhibitor of the Cdk/cyclin repertoire (Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4 and Cdk6 paired with their respective cyclin partners e.g., cyclin A, B1, B2, D1 and D3) and is an important regulator of the cell cycle. p21 has been shown to activate Cdk4 (and Cdk6). p21-dependent inhibition of cell cycle progression from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase is mediated by inhibition of Cdk4/(and Cdk6)/D-type cyclin complexes, and Cdk2/cyclin E (and cyclin A) complexes. Additionally, p21-dependent arrest in G<sub>2</sub> phase is mediated by inhibition of Cdk1/cyclin B1. p21-KID fully inhibits Cdk2/cyclin A with a K<sub>i</sub> value of 0.3 nM, indicative of thermodynamically very favorableinteractions between p21-KID and Cdk2/cyclin A. The presence of sub-domains D1 and D2, connected by the LH sub-domain, is associated with high Cdk2 inhibitory potency (IC<sub>50</sub> < 5 nM), despite the relatively weak binding of p21-D2 to Cdk2. p21-KID exhibited similar IC<sub>50</sub> values toward Cdk4/cyclin D1 and Cdk6/cyclin D1 (7.5 and 11 nM, respectively). Variants, where LH was increased or decreased by three residues (p21-KID-LH<sub>+3</sub> and p21-KID-LH<sub>-3</sub>) were significantly less potent toward these complexes, despite the very similar structural characteristics. Thus LH dynamics affects p21 promiscuity.p21 LH sub-domain variants were also variably deficient in G<sub>1</sub>/S and G<sub>2</sub> arrest.			Sub-domain LH, which adopts a partially α-helical conformation, plays primarily a structural role by tethering sub-domains D1 and D2.Amides at the extreme C-terminus of sub-domain LH, appeared to be rigid. In contrast, amides in the center of this sub-domain (residues 34-44) exhibit hetNOE values between +0.3 and +0.4, indicative of increased mobility in comparison with those in sub-domains D1 and D2. Further, resonances for seven residues within the N-terminal portion of sub-domain LH were not observed, possibly due to dynamic conformational exchange. Thus hetNOE results suggested that many residues within sub-domain LH remain dynamic when p21-KID was bound to Cdk2/cyclin A. Multidisciplinary studies revealed that, when p21 is bound to Cdk2/cyclin A, sub-domain LH is not rigid but rather dynamic, allowing it to serve as an adaptable linker between sub-domains D1 and D2.			Fuzziness of sub-domain LH allows p21 to adaptively bind to the individual complexes which comprise the Cdk/cyclin repertoire that regulates cell division.

The methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) family proteins recognize this methylated mark and repress the associated genes by recruiting different co-repressor complexes. The isolated MBD shows rapid on and off-rates, which requires steady state analysis to determine the overall binding affinity(K<sub>D</sub> = 330 nM). The MBD2FLsc (150-393 AA) shows an &Tilde;100-fold increase in affinity (K<sub>D</sub> = 2 nM) as compared to the structured MBD2<sub>MBD</sub> (K<sub>D</sub>=330 nM). Mutations of two highly conserved residues (Arg 286, Leu 287) diminishes interactions with the histone deacetylase core complex, albeit these residues are located in the central portion, which might adopt a stable α-helical structure upon binding.			2D <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum of the MBD2FLsc protein (150-393 AA, containing MBD<sub>IDR</sub> and CC domains) bound to methylated DNA contains a few broadened and dispersed as well as many sharp and highly degenerate resonances. Plotting <sup>1</sup> H,<sup>15</sup> N chemical shift differences between resonances from the isolated MBD2<sub>IDR</sub> and the same region in the MBD2FLsc:DNA confirms that the chemical shifts are very similar throughout the region (&#916; < 0.05ppm). These findings show that the MBD2<sub>IDR</sub> region remains largely disordered even in the context of full-length protein and does not appear to affect the structure or DNA binding mode of the MBD. 		bmrb:25426	Fuzziness enables a dynamic architecture of the NuRD complex wherein the subunits carrying the chromatin remodeling enzymatic activities unique to the NuRD complex can be mapped to two separate domains of MBD2: the MBD2<sub>IDR</sub>.

FC00088	Q15004	PCNA-associated factor, p15<sup>PAF</sup>	PCNA	X-ray, NMR	2-50, 72-111	p15<sup>PAF</sup> regulates DNA replication and repair by binding to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) sliding clamp. Changes in the NMR spectra of p15 and PCNA in the presence of each other confirm a direct interaction between both proteins. Three p15 molecules bind to the trimeric PCNA ring with low micromolar affinity (1.1 &#181;M), with no indication of cooperativity. Truncation constructs show that the affinity of p15<sup>50-77</sup> is reduced by a factor of 5, while that of p15<sup>59-70</sup> is reduced by 33-fold. The N-terminal regions (2-31 AA) provides small contribution to catalysis by transient interactions. This indicates that the disordered 71-77 region importantly contributes to binding.			The central region of p15, including the PIP-box, is tightly bound to the front-face and inner surface of PCNA, while the N- and C-termini remain predominantly disordered at its back- and front-face, respectively, with transient interactions at the PCNA outer surface. NMR signal intensities decrease generally and most notably for the central residues V53-D75 including the PIP box (<sup>62</sup>QKGIGEFF<sup>69</sup>). The p15 NMR signals still visible in the complex retain their low dispersion, indicating that they remain largely disordered and flexible. NMR spectra suggests only transient interactions between the p15 termini and PCNA. In the ensemble of p15-PCNA complexes, most of the bound p15 chains have their flexible N- and C-termini protrude at the opposite back and front faces of the PCNA ring, respectively. In structure determined from X-ray crystallography, only residues 51-71 are visible in the electron density map, but the side chains of N51, R70 and L71 could not be reliably modelled.	pdb:4d2g		Fuzziness of p15 enables to regulate PCNA sliding along the DNA that facilitates the switch from replicative to translesionsynthesis polymerase binding.

The affinity of p15 for DNA is 0.2-0.4 &#181;M, that is decreased by an order of magnitude upon increasing the salt concentration. The affinity of p15<sup>&#916;N</sup> (missing 2-31 AA) is reduced by two orders of magnitude, indicating that the basic N-terminal region of p15 contributes most to the DNA affinity. The central fragment p15<sup>50-77</sup> binds DNA with even lower affinity, and no DNA binding was observed with the core PIP-box fragment p15<sup>59-70</sup>.The slightly reduced DNA affinity shows that PCNA interferes only weakly with p15 binding to DNA. Similarly, when DNA-bound p15 was  titrated with PCNA, the PCNA affinity was comparable to that of isolated p15 (or p15<sup>50-77</sup>). Thus, a ternary p15-PCNA- DNA complex forms in solution in which the direct p15-PCNA and p15-DNA interactions are largely independent of each other.			In the complex of p15 with 24 bp DNA, several resonances were perturbed as compared to the free protein, with largest CPS around the basic residues in the N-terminal region and smallest CPS for the acidic residues in the C-terminal region. The poor H<sup>N</sup> signal dispersion and only minor changes in C<sup>a</sup> chemical shifts indicate that p15 does not acquire a defined structure on binding to the DNA; rather, its backbone remains flexible and disordered. In the presence of PCNA, p15 shows similar NMR pattern attenuation with and without DNA, which is also consistent with weak binding without gaining a definite structure. Transmission electron microscopy shows increased electron density within the PCNA ring.			The fuzzy N-terminal tail of p15 may act as an extended arm that captures and binds the DNA fibre at the back-face of PCNA.

HSQC intensities decrease towards the C terminus, indicating that residues outside the canonical motif contact the MAPK surface. NMR relaxation rates (R2 values) indicate conformational exchange of MKK7 on the microsecond to millisecond timescale. CEST and RD experiments also show conformational exchange for residues in and around D2 and D3 motifs.In the crystal structure of the D2 docking site of MKK7 with JNK1, alternative conformations were observed. These resemble the active and auto-inhibited conformations of JNK1, indicating functional relevance.	pdb:4ux9		Fuzziness contributes to different apparent binding mechanisms and different interaction kinetics for the distinct JNK1 interaction sites.

Binding to S100B negatively affects phosphorylation of RSK1 by ERK. S100B binds to a C-terminal RSK1 segment that is required not only for ERK2 recruitment but also for the autoinhibition of the RSK1 CaMK-type domain. Thus S100B not only directly interferes with the assembly of the ERK2-RSK1 heterodimeric complex, but also negatively affects the activity of the CaMK-type domain of RSK1. Affinity of the C terminal region of RSK1 (712-735 AA) for S100B is K<sub>D</sub>=4 &#181;M, while the segment including 683-735 AA makes high affinity binding with K<sub>D</sub>=40 nM. Mutation of any of the 685-688 residues to Ala decreased binding by one order of magnitude.		PhaSepDB:Q15418	Crystal structures of RSK1 constructs with N-terminal truncations at 683, 689, 696 in complex with S100B have been determined. The RSK1 peptides exhibited very different bound conformations, but only very short regions of the 683-735 segment could be localized (697-704, 725-731), the rest of the sequence remained to be disordered in the complex. The polymorphic nature of the bound conformations is also illustrated by the diversity of secondary structures adopted by the linear motif upon interacting with the canonical docking site: coil and helix, respectively. HSQC spectrum of the intervening segment (clamp) remain unchanged upon S100B binding.

AF9 is able to recruit and activate P-TEFb through recruitment of AF4 family members via the ANC1 homology domain (AHD). Disruption of the AF4-AF9 interaction results in necrotic cell death in several cell lines harboring MLL translocations. By fluorescence anisotropy the affinity for AF4 is extremely high (K<sub>D</sub> = 0.17 ± 0.05 nM). The significant amount of conformational entropy may partially compensate for the loss of conformational entropy during coupled folding and binding.Similarly high affinity was observed for Dot1L (1.6 ± 0.3 nM) and BCoR (32 ± 20 nM), however the peptide from hPC3 binds with much lower affinity (K<sub>D</sub> > 0.9 &#181;M). The hPC3 sequence lacks a buried valine residue which is part of the consensus sequence, and introduction V335 in the hPC3 peptide decreased the dissociation constant between AF9 and hPC3 to 8.7 ± 0.7 nM.			The complex retains a significant amount of conformational entropy. <sup>15</sup>N backbone relaxation data indicate conformational exchange in the complex on both ps-ns and ms-&#181;s timescales. Several AF9 loops, particularly those near the AF4 peptide, are involved in conformational exchange. The loop from 515-519 shows fast timescale dynamics, and 534-542 show ms-&#181;s exchange. The NOESY spectra suggest significant internal dynamics in the core of the protein which are reflected in the backbone. The HSQC spectrum of AHD is very similar in the presence of other binding partners, such as hPC3, Dot1L and BCoR, suggesting that their binding takes place in a mutually exclusive manner.	pdb:2lm0	bmrb:18094	Fuzziness of the complex allows exchange between binding partners in response to changes in local concentrations orpost-translational modifications, which may be essential to dynamic transcriptional control.

It is one of the best known members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) scaffold proteins that organize events of signal transduction, cell adhesion, and molecular trafficking at specialized cell-cell junctions such as synapses and tight junctions. Gly-Ser substitutions in residues 396-401 and 411-424 in the linker of our PDZ3-SH3 construct has a near- identical effect to CRIPT binding, reducing iPREs at the binding face and reorienting PDZ3 relative to SH3. Thus CRIPT binding and linker replacement disrupt the weak, but specific, interaction of PDZ3 and SH3-GK.		PhaSepDB:P31016 region:1-724	SAXS suggests that PDZ3 contacts SH3-GK, but PDZ3 is not rigidly locked against SH3-GK. chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) of PDZ3 due to the presence of SH3 were modest, consistent with a weak interdomain interaction. iPRE measurements and EOM-SAXS analysis consistently show a dynamic interaction between PDZ3 and SH3-GK. Addition of CRIPT peptide to PDZ3-SH3 reduced the iPREs at residues proximal to the PDZ3 peptide binding groove indicating movement of this binding site away from the SH3 spin label. CRIPT binding also serves to rotate PDZ3 to bring other residues slightly closer, on average, to SH3.Ala mutation of L411 and M412 at the central part of the linker increases <sup>15</sup>N T<sub>2</sub> relaxation rates by 10-15 ms by incresed tumbling of PDZ3. This is consistent with the model that binding of the linker hydrophobic motif mediates the dynamic association between PDZ3 and SH3-GK.			Fuzziness mediates allosteric communication between the PDZ3 and GK domains and serve to regulate the overall length of PSD-95, which may be an important parameter for dynamic remodeling of the PSD.

FC00096	P16333	Adaptor protein Nck	Nck SH3	NMR	81-110	Nck plays a role in diverse cellular processes, including axon guidance, cell movement, cell-cell fusion, stress responses, and maintenance of cell-cell adhesions, which are achieved via the polymerization of actin through Nck/neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP)/Arp2/3 complex pathways.Nck phase-separates upon interaction with proline-rich motifs (PRMs) of N-WASP, which occurs at lower concentrations when pTyr-containing phosphorylated nephrin (p-nephrin) is present. Phase separation is dependent on both the number of pTyr motifs in p-nephrin and SH3 domains in Nck. The linker between the first and second SH3 domains of Nck (L1) affects the phase separation behavior of p-nephrin/Nck/N-WASP oligomers. The S2-L2- S3-L3-SH2 does not phase-separate even up to a concentration of 250 &#181;M plus 250 &#181;M N-WASP, but adding L1 lowers the phase boundary to 30 &#181;M (for both partners). The L1 has 10 basic residues lie within its N-terminal half, and five acidic residues lie within its C-terminal half. Deletion of the first N-terminal 17 residues, or only the KVKRK motif, or even mutation of three Lys in this region, inhibited phase-separation (boundary above 250 &#181;M concentration plus 250 &#181;M N-WASP). In contrast, increasing the overall positive charge of L1 or charge density in the N terminal region enhances phase separation. These trends were similar in the presence of p-nephrin. L1 does not impact the affinity for N-WASP, instead it promotes self-assembly of Nck based on dynamic light scattering measurements, also supported by NMR data (see above).	Plays a role in the DNA damage response, not in the detection of the damage by ATM/ATR, but for efficient activation of downstream effectors, such as that of CHEK2. Plays a role in ELK1-dependent transcriptional activation in response to activated Ras signaling. May play a role in cell adhesion and migration through interaction with ephrin receptors. NCK1 has three SRC-homology 3 (SH3) domains that bind multiple proline-rich segments in the actin regulatory protein neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and an SH2 domain that binds to multiple phosphotyrosine sites in the adhesion protein nephrin, leading to phase separation.

The spectrum of L1-S2-L2- S3-L3-SH2 and L1-S2 shows a series of intense, poorly dispersed resonances, representing disordered, dynamic residues. Peaks corresponding to the C-terminal acidic portion of L1 have high and relatively uniform intensity, whereas peaks in the N terminus are appreciably weaker. Five of the N-terminal 11 residues could not be assigned due to exchange broadening; the first Lys residue of the KVKRK motif also could not be assigned. These data indicate variable, weak-affinity interactions, which was estimated to have Kd value of 1.3 mM based on <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra.			Fuzzy, weak interactions between the linker and the SH3 domain of Nck contribute to increasing valency and combinatorial crosslinking within the Nck/N-WASP/nephrin assembly and promote phase separation.

FC00097	P35637	Fused in Sarcoma (FUS)	FUS	NMR	1-163	FUS is an RNA-binding protein, which localizes both to cytoplasmic RNP granules and transcriptionally active nuclear puncta and is associated with processes spanning transcriptional regulation, pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA transport and stability. FUS is associated with protein aggregation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) as well as chromosomal translocation in certain sarcomas and leukemias. FUS LC form granules in vitro, which flow, fuse and spontaneously return to a spherical shape as observed for cytoplasmic RNP granules. Granule formation for FUS LC was weakly dependent on increasing salt concentration (until 150 mM), suggesting that primarily not the electrostatic interactions stabilized the FUS granule.RNA polymerase II CTD can directly interact with FUS LC domain phase-separated states and can nucleate their assembly.	FUS (RNA-binding protein FUS), an essential paraspeckle component, has 27 repeats of Y[G/S]QQ or [S/G]Y[S/G] and contains a N terminal PLD and a RRM domain, two RGG-rich domains separated by a zinc finger (ZnF), and a non-canonical PY nuclear localization signal (NLS). The LC domains, includes the N-terminal SYGQ-rich domain and C-terminal three RGG domains enriched in RGG/RG motifs that are extensively modified with asymmetric dimethyl groups by PRMT1 or PRMT8.The PLDs of FUS family proteins are intrinsically disordered and have low complexity. The PLDs are typically enriched in tyrosine. The RBDs comprise one or more folded RNA recognition modules (RNA recognition motif, RRM), but they also carry regions of significant intrinsic disorder. The intrinsically disordered regions in RBDs are typically enriched in glycine and positively charged residues, such as arginine.FUS forms liquid compartments at sites of DNA damage and in the cytoplasm upon stress. It is enriched in the nucleus and involved in transcription, DNA repair, and RNA biogenesis.

NMR relaxation experiments (<sup>15</sup>N R<sub>2</sub>, <sup>15</sup>N R<sub>1</sub>, heteronuclear NOE) also show that the FUS LC domain is uniformly disordered in monomeric form. The lack of large variations in these dynamic observables due to slower rotational diffusion in structured areas indicates that no stable structured subregions of FUS LC are formed. This is also consistent with CD data.In phase separated state, FUS LC yielded observable but broad resonances in the <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N HSQC, suggesting that some local motions are retained in the higher-order assembly.  <sup>1</sup>H <sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra is highly similar to those of the monomeric FUS LC (50 mM), demonstrating that the global disordered structure is also retained in the phase-separated state. The lack of large chemical shift differences in <sup>1</sup>H <sup>13</sup>C HSQC spectra between the phase-separated and dispersed phases indicates that no significant conformational changes has occurred and the local structure of the protein also remains disordered in the phase- separated state. Local motions of the peptide as measured by <sup>15</sup>N spin relaxation experiments show evidence for restricted mobility compared to that of the monomeric, dispersed protein. Conformational exchange processes, if any, likely occur faster than the millisecond timescale. Upon interaction with RNAP II CTD, two-dimensional NMR spectra show that the CTD signal is nearly uniformly attenuated to ~75% of the control sample, indicating that monomers of the CTD are incorporated into, or interact with, the FUS LC phase-separated state.			Fuzziness of FUS LC contributes to the elevated dynamics of the RNP granules and enables a rapid exchange with the environment of the droplet. Variable conformations also mediate interactions with RNAP II CTD, without a significant stabilization of any structural states.

FC00099	P14907	Nsp1	Kap95	NMR	274-397	Nsp1 is an FG-Nup, which is part of the yeast nuclear pore complex (NPC) that forms a selective filter to allow the rapid passage of transport factors (TFs) and their cargoes across the nuclear envelope, while blocks the passage of other macromolecules. The affinity of Kap95 for the FSFG-K was estimated from a titration observing <sup>15</sup>N R<sub>2</sub> and resulted in K<sub>d</sub> > 36 &#181;M, which is fully consistent with rapid, reversible transport.		PhaSepDB:P14907 region:2-601 region:1-601, PhaSePro:P14907 region:2-601	Based on NMR data, FG Nups were fully disordered and highly dynamic in all cellular milieu, which were tested and <sup>13</sup>C chemical shift values indicate negligible secondary structures.Upon interacting with Kap95, the majority of peaks in the 2D HSQC spectrum of FSFG-K are minimally affected, showing that the corresponding residues remain disordered and dynamic. The degree of signal attenuation falls off relatively uniformly at both sides of each FG repeat, consistent with the transient binding of individual FG residues, with the remaining residues remaining fully disordered and highly dynamic. No major state change of spacers resulting from TF addition, such as caused by the formation or breakage of secondary structure, or gel/sol transitions has been observed.			Fuzziness enables FG repeat regions to form a highly dynamic phase and interact via a variety of TFs, consistent with the rapid rates of nuclear transport.

FC00100	Q9I832	Osteopontin (OPN)	Heparin	NMR	90-120	Osteopontin is an extracellular matrix protein (sialoprotein) that functions in cell attachment by displaying a RGD cell adhesion sequence and as a cytokine that signals through integrin and CD44 cell adhesion molecules. OPN is also implicated in human tumor progression and cell invasion. OPN has intrinsic transforming activity, and elevated OPN levels promote metastasis. Based on ITC measurements the &#916;H and &#916;S values for OPN-heparin binding are -16.3 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> and -35 cal mol <sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>, giving a dissociation constant of 34 &#181;M. A positive differential heat capacity, &#916;Cp, (about 40 calmol<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>) for heparin binding further supports that OPN in the bound state exhibits more conformational flexibility than in the free state.			The PRE data indicate that the central segment (residues 90 - 150) of OPN expands upon heparin binding, comparable to an &#147;unfolding-upon-binding&#148; event. <sup>15</sup>N relaxation measurements show that residues 90-120 exhibit increased backbone flexibility as evidenced by both decreased R<sub>2</sub> values and more negative heteronuclear NOEs consistent with higher conformational flexibility in the bound state. NMR measurements show that hydrodynamic radius of OPN increases through heparin binding from 3.6 nm to 5.2 nm. Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) measurements on six spin-labeled Cys double mutants indicating increased distances between the labeling sites of the six double mutants, in accord with the expansion of OPN upon heparin binding.			Fuzziness provides compensation for the entropic penalty of binding and contributes to modulating the lifetime and rates of conversions of individual bound states.

FC00101	A6Q0K5	Calvin cycle protein CP12	GAPDH	EPR	1-50	CP12 is a widespread regulatory protein of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms that contributes to the regulation of the Calvin cycle by forming a supra-molecular complex with at least two enzymes: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK). K<sub>D</sub> for CP12 for GAPDH is nM. In vitro reconstitution tests supported that the binary complex with the N-terminal regions was formed. Y78S and D80K abolished the regulation of GAPDH in the supra-molecular complex.			The labeled variants C31S and C23S allowed the spin label dynamics grafted at Cys23 and Cys31 to be monitored. Addition of GAPDH in an equimolar ratio or in molar excess did not induce any significant change in the EPR spectral shape, the N terminal region of CP12 remains almost as mobile as in the unbound state. Although this N-terminal region can fold into an α-helical structure under oxidized conditions or upon adding TFE, EPR results show that the labeled CP12 variants remain fully disordered even after binding to GAPDH.The C-terminal region in the vicinity of the binding site is also dynamic, around the spin label at position Tyr78.			Fuzziness is also important for dynamic assembly and disassembly processes controlled by dark/light transitions, for example it facilitates binding of PRK to CP12-GAPDH to form the ternary supra-molecular complex.

FC00102	P13199	ORF57	RNA, ALYREF	NMR	81-92	ORF57 is an essential herpesvirus adaptor protein, which promotes viral mRNA export by utilizing the cellular mRNA export machinery. ORF57 protein specifically recognizes viral mRNA transcripts, and binds to proteins of the cellular transcription-export complex, in particular ALYREF. This interaction introduces viral mRNA to the NXF1 pathway, subsequently directing it to the nuclear pore for export to the cytoplasm. The ORF57 mutants Y81A+R82A, R88A+ significantly reduced the efficiency of cross-linking with RNA 14merS and R79A+V80A and R94A+I95A in the flanking region reduced the cytoplasmic accumulation of RNA.The experimental fluorescence equilibrium binding data reveals the overall cooperativity in the ternary complex formation when the components are present at or near stoichiometric amounts, and support a role of ORF57 as an adaptor introducing RNA to ALYREF. K<sub>D</sub> of ORF57<sup>8-120</sup> and RNA is 7.5 &#181;M, and K<sub>D</sub> of  RNA binding to the ORF57-ALYREF is 1.55±0.24 &#181;M indicating cooperativity between ORF57 and ALYREF in RNA binding.The fluorescence data are also consistent with a local competitiveness of ORF57-ALYREF and ORF57-RNA interactions: this competitiveness becomes apparent only if RNA is in significant excess.			Signal perturbation mapping suggested a specific RNA binding site encompassing aa64-120 within ORF57<sup>8-120</sup>, whereas the ALYREF-binding region aa103-120 located within this site is not sufficient for the recognition of specific viral RNA. Saturation transfer mapping, in line with signal perturbation mapping showed that that ORF57<sup>8-120</sup> contacts the specific RNA motifs directly using primarily its regions aa107-120 and aa81-92, with additional contribution from residues within aa94-105 and aa64- 79. Addition of both specific and non-specific RNA oligos caused only small NMR signal shifts in the 10-40 AA acidic region of ORF57<sup>8-120</sup>.Saturation transfer IDIS NMR experiments show that both ORF57 and ALYREF retained a high degree of flexibility, even for residues directly involved in interactions. Amide signals from flexible protein regions which become involved in direct contacts with RNA (as evidenced by RNA-protein saturation transfer), are only partially broadened in the complex suggesting that the interaction with RNA in these conditions was somewhat transient and did not lead to the formation of a rigid 3D structure.			Transient interactions within fuzzy flanking regions contribute to the overall stability of the complex. ORF57 also serves to bridge the interaction between viral RNA and cellular ALYREF, cooperatively enhancing the formation of the ternary complex, without allosterically remodeling ALYREF.

ALYREF associates with the 5&#39; end of cellular mRNAs during splicing. ALYREF may be recruited by viral adaptors to stabilize the viral nuclear RNAs independently of their export. A very weak non-specific binding of RNA to ALYREF was observed with estimated K<sub>D</sub> of 50 mM. K<sub>D</sub> of RNA binding to the ORF57-ALYREF is 1.55±0.24 &#181;M, indicating a cooperative behavior of ALYREF and ORF57. K<sub>D</sub> of ALYREF for ORF57-RNA is 0.52 &#181;M, 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the binary complex with RNA. K<sub>D</sub> of ORF57<sup>8-120</sup> and ALYREF<sup>1-155</sup> is 2.56±0.20 &#181;M, also consistent with the cooperativity of the ternary complex.			NMR signal intensity of the N-terminal region aa22-48 of ALYREF does not reduce significantly upon RNA binding in the presence of ORF57, suggesting that this interaction is relatively transient.As evidenced by NMR signal shapes and lack of RNA-protein NOEs the N-terminal regions of both ORF57 and ALYREF in contact with RNA retain significant flexibility when the ternary RNA-ORF57-ALYREF complex is formed. The main NXF1-binding region of ALYREF aa15-36 partially overlaps with region involved in viral mRNA binding, and remains sufficiently exposed.	pdb:2yka		Fuzziness of the ternary RNA-ORF57-ALYREF complex enables combination of competitive and cooperative binding of partially-overlapping multifunctional binding sites for the assembly and disassembly of mRNA nuclear export complexes thus facilitating a key molecular transfer event in herpesvirus highjacking of the host nuclear export pathway.

As part of the antibacterial innate response, NGAL binds the bacterial siderophore enterobactin with high affinity and sequesters enterobactin during a bacterial infection. This withdraws the siderophore from the bacterium thereby limiting its access to environmental iron. hLCN2-R-NTD binds to NGAL with an affinity (K<sub>D</sub>) of 10 &#181;M in 1:1 stoichiometry. The thermodynamic parameters of binding indicate that the binding is enthalpically driven but includes a non-negligible entropic contribution (&#916;H = -4.5 kcal/mol <sup>-1</sup> ; &#916;T&#916;S = -2.3 kcalmol<sup>-1</sup> at 25 °C). hLCN2-R-NTD does not, or poorly bind to holo-NGAL.			<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of hLCN2-R-NTD devoid of any stable secondary or tertiary structures and indicates significant conformational exchange on the micro-to-millisecond timescale. Upon interactions with NGAL only very limited chemical shift changes can be observed, which is strongest for the C-terminal part of hLCN2-R-NTD where most of the resonances completely vanished upon the addition of only 0.3 eq of NGAL. Most resonances remain visible even in presence of 2 eq. of unlabeled NGAL, although the N-terminal part seems more affected than the middle of the protein. The reciprocal experiment with unlabeled hLCN2-R-NTD and labeled NGAL provided the same result. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement of the NGAL-hLCN2-R-NTD complex shows that the N-terminal part of hLCN2-R-NTD is significantly affected, owing to its spatial proximity to the C-terminal part, and also with NGAL in the complex. An enhanced intensity decrease was observed for the middle part of the protein, which indicates transient interactions with the paramagnetic NGAL. Exchange rate obtained from relaxation dispersion experiments (k<sub>ex</sub> 1200-1300 s<sup>-1</sup>) are consistent with complex series of binding events.		bmrb:26579	Fuzziness of the complex could be a mechanism that allows a fine-tuning of the interaction between NGAL and its cellular receptor or a biochemical mechanism allowing the receptor to discriminate between apo- and holo-NGAL.

FC00105	P04370	Myelin basic protein (MBP), 18.5 kDa isoform	Fyn SH3	NMR	38-71	MBP (myelin basic protein is a highly positively-charged, developmentally regulated protein family expressed from the gene in the oligodendrocyte lineage, which carries out the adhesion of the cytoplasmic leaflets of compact myelin in central nervous system. During oligodendrocyte development and myelination MBP interacts with Fyn kinase via a central proline-rich region. In addition to SH3 domains, MBP has many binding partners, e.g. calmodulin, cortactin, cytoskeletal proteins. N- and C-terminal deletion experiments show that binding between MBP and Fyn is non-specific in the absence of the 56 N-terminal amino acids, but is not affected by the absence of 63 C-terminal residues. Cells that were co-transfected with both constitutively-active Fyn and full-length 18.5 kDa MBP exhibited third-degree (tertiary) branching, which dropped upon truncation of 40-50 N-terminal residues. The shorter, 72-107 MBP segment can also bind to Fyn, but the N-terminal flanking region improves affinity.			S38-S107 peptide (termed as xα2-peptide) of MBP shows poor dispersion in the proton dimension (7.7-8.6 ppm) of the <sup> 15</sup> N-HSQC spectrum. Upon binding to Fyn-SH3 (9.3 kDa), no significant change in secondary structure propensity regarding the overall random coil content of 83.5 % was observed. The chemical shifts of the xα2-peptide were systematically perturbed upon titration with the Fyn-SH3 domain resulting in K<sub>D</sub> of low &#181;M range (approx < 10 &#181;M). Relaxation rates indicate that the overall tumbling of the peptide backbone has lowered upon Fyn-SH3 interactions, especially for distinct segments T62-L68 and V83-S99. NOE values reflect more restricted backbone motions on the picosecond-nanosecond timescale.		bmrb:19949	Fuzziness enables posttranslational modifications to modulate the conformational properties of the ensemble in the bound form thereby contributing to the conformational switch mechanism and trigger Fyn to the oligodendrocyte membrane.

FC00108	Q6MRH6	Bd0108	Bd0109	NMR	24-101	Bd0108 is a central regulatory element to switch from the host-independent (HI) to host-dependent (HD) lifestyle of the bacteria. The proteins Bd0108 and Bd0109 interact directly and work in concert to both promote the secretion of the B. bacteriovorus pilus and to regulate pilus length. Mutations or deletions in Bd0108 lock the B. bacteriovorus in HI form. ITC provides a dissociation constant of 45 &#181;M with an observed stoichiometry of 3:1 (Bd0108:Bd0109). Enthalpy of binding is negative (22075 kcal/mole), the entropy is positive (12.92 cal K<sup>-1</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>), showing that both hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions contribute to binding. The high micro-molar K<sub>d</sub> is characteristic of transient interactions, such as those involved in signaling or secretion pathways.			Bd0108 has no regular secondary structure and functions as a monomeric extended conformational ensemble. In the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum the C terminal 74-85 residues of Bd0108 show only moderate signal loss, while residues 89-101 are unaffected by interactions with Bd0109. N-terminal residues 24-66 are the site of binding to Bd0109, which enter into chemical exchange in the presence of Bd0109, on a &#181;sec to msec time scale, also likely adopting many different states/conformations upon interactions.		bmrb:25327	Fuzziness may contribute to interactions with many other binding partners that affect the lifestyle switch of the bacteria.

FC00109	P45985	MAPK kinase MKK4 	p38α	NMR	49-62	Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling transmits extracellular proliferative signals into the nucleus. In the kinase cascade, MAPK kinase kinase phosphorylates MAPK kinase, which in turn phosphorylates MAPK. MKK4 can specifically activate both p38 or JNK to initiate cell proliferation, differentiation, migration or cell death. The p38 complex is stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines. Although the docking site motif is essential for binding of p38α, the KIS domain encodes specificity toward different phosphatases. The KIS domain was shown to enhance affinity and specificity towards hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase.		PhaSepDB:P45985	Relaxation dispersion (RD) and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) indicates a two-site exchange model via the canonical motif (40-48) as well as the KIS domain, with nearly identical bound populations of the two regions.

NF-kappa-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NFKB1/p105, NFKB1/p50, REL and NFKB2/p52. The heterodimeric RELA-NFKB1 complex appears to be most abundant one. The dimers bind at kappa-B sites in the DNA of their target genes and the individual dimers have distinct preferences for different kappa-B sites that they can bind with distinguishable affinity and specificity. Different dimer combinations act as transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively. The NF-kappa-B heterodimeric RELA-NFKB1 and RELA-REL complexes, for instance, function as transcriptional activators. NF-kappa-B is controlled by various mechanisms of post-translational modification and subcellular compartmentalization as well as by interactions with other cofactors or corepressors. NF-kappa-B complexes are held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state complexed with members of the NF-kappa-B inhibitor (I-kappa-B) family. In a conventional activation pathway, I-kappa-B is phosphorylated by I-kappa-B kinases (IKKs) in response to different activators, subsequently degraded thus liberating the active NF-kappa-B complex which translocates to the nucleus. The inhibitory effect of I-kappa-B on NF-kappa-B through retention in the cytoplasm is exerted primarily through the interaction with RELA.

FC00119	P51532	Transcription activator BRG1	Bromodomain-containing protein 3	NMR	634-677	Involved in transcriptional activation and repression of select genes by chromatin remodeling (alteration of DNA-nucleosome topology). Component of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes that carry out key enzymatic activities, changing chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome in an ATP-dependent manner. Component of the CREST-BRG1 complex, a multiprotein complex that regulates promoter activation by orchestrating the calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and the recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-FOS promoter is inhibited by SMARCA4-dependent recruitment of a phospho-RB1-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, RB1 is dephosphorylated by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CREBBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 complex also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves the release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CREBBP. Belongs to the neural progenitors-specific chromatin remodeling complex (npBAF complex) and the neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complex (nBAF complex). During neural development, a switch from a stem/progenitor to a postmitotic chromatin remodeling mechanism occurs as neurons exit the cell cycle and become committed to their adult state. The transition from proliferating neural stem/progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons requires a switch in subunit composition of the npBAF and nBAF complexes. As neural progenitors exit mitosis and differentiate into neurons, npBAF complexes which contain ACTL6A/BAF53A and PHF10/BAF45A, are exchanged for homologous alternative ACTL6B/BAF53B and DPF1/BAF45B or DPF3/BAF45C subunits in neuron-specific complexes (nBAF). The npBAF complex is essential for the self-renewal/proliferative capacity of the multipotent neural stem cells. The nBAF complex along with CREST plays a role regulating the activity of genes essential for dendrite growth. SMARCA4/BAF190A may promote neural stem cell self-renewal/proliferation by enhancing Notch-dependent proliferative signals, while concurrently making the neural stem cell insensitive to SHH-dependent differentiating cues (By similarity). Acts as a corepressor of ZEB1 to regulate E-cadherin transcription and is required for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by ZEB1. Binds via DLX1 to enhancers located in the intergenic region between DLX5 and DLX6 and this binding is stabilized by the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Evf2 (By similarity). Binds to RNA in a promiscuous manner (By similarity). Binding to RNAs including lncRNA Evf2 leads to inhibition of SMARCA4 ATPase and chromatin remodeling activities (By similarity)		PhaSepDB:P51532	634-677 region remain disordered in the complex, with Bromodomain-containing protein 3 based on NMR data.	pdb:6bgh		The fuzzy region contributes to molecular recognition of transcriptional coregulators via a short peptide motif.

Specifically recognizes and binds hemimethylated DNA at replication forks via its YDG domain and recruits DNMT1 methyltransferase to ensure faithful propagation of the DNA methylation patterns through DNA replication. In addition to its role in maintenance of DNA methylation, also plays a key role in chromatin modification: through its tudor-like regions and PHD-type zinc fingers, specifically recognizes and binds histone H3 trimethylated at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me3) and unmethylated at 'Arg-2' (H3R2me0), respectively, and recruits chromatin proteins. Enriched in pericentric heterochromatin where it recruits different chromatin modifiers required for this chromatin replication. Also localizes to euchromatic regions where it negatively regulates transcription possibly by impacting DNA methylation and histone modifications.

Inactive FYN is phosphorylated on its C-terminal tail within the catalytic domain. Following activation by PKA, the protein subsequently associates with PTK2/FAK1, allowing PTK2/FAK1 phosphorylation, activation and targeting to focal adhesions. Involved in the regulation of cell adhesion and motility through phosphorylation of CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) and CTNND1 (delta-catenin). Regulates cytoskeletal remodeling by phosphorylating several proteins including the actin regulator WAS and the microtubule-associated proteins MAP2 and MAPT. Promotes cell survival by phosphorylating AGAP2/PIKE-A and preventing its apoptotic cleavage. Participates in signal transduction pathways that regulate the integrity of the glomerular slit diaphragm (an essential part of the glomerular filter of the kidney) by phosphorylating several slit diaphragm components including NPHS1, KIRREL1 and TRPC6. Plays a role in neural processes by phosphorylating DPYSL2, a multifunctional adapter protein within the central nervous system, ARHGAP32, a regulator for Rho family GTPases implicated in various neural functions, and SNCA, a small pre-synaptic protein. Participates in the downstream signaling pathways that lead to T-cell differentiation and proliferation following T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Phosphorylates PTK2B/PYK2 in response to T-cell receptor activation. Also participates in negative feedback regulation of TCR signaling through phosphorylation of PAG1, thereby promoting interaction between PAG1 and CSK and recruitment of CSK to lipid rafts. CSK maintains LCK and FYN in an inactive form. Promotes CD28-induced phosphorylation of VAV1. In mast cells, phosphorylates CLNK after activation of immunoglobulin epsilon receptor signaling (By similarity)	Non-receptor tyrosine-protein kinase that plays a role in many biological processes including regulation of cell growth and survival, cell adhesion, integrin-mediated signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, cell motility, immune response and axon guidance. Inactive FYN is phosphorylated on its C-terminal tail within the catalytic domain. The RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 (hnRNPA2) carries mRNA targets in MLOs called transport granules in neurons and oligodendrocytes. At sites of local translation, hnRNPA2 is phosphorylated by the tyrosine protein kinase Fyn, releasing the mRNA for translation. Fyn recognizes targets through its SH3 domain (Fyn-SH3).

FC00127	P08238	Heat shock protein HSP 90-beta	TPR repeat-containing protein associated with Hsp90	NMR	45-55	Molecular chaperone that promotes the maturation, structural maintenance and proper regulation of specific target proteins involved for instance in cell cycle control and signal transduction. Undergoes a functional cycle linked to its ATPase activity. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation. Interacts dynamically with various co-chaperones that modulate its substrate recognition, ATPase cycle and chaperone function (PubMed:16478993, PubMed:19696785). Engages with a range of client protein classes via its interaction with various co-chaperone proteins or complexes, that act as adapters, simultaneously able to interact with the specific client and the central chaperone itself. Recruitment of ATP and co-chaperone followed by client protein forms a functional chaperone. After the completion of the chaperoning process, properly folded client protein and co-chaperone leave HSP90 in an ADP-bound partially open conformation and finally, ADP is released from HSP90 which acquires an open conformation for the next cycle (PubMed:27295069, PubMed:26991466). Apart from its chaperone activity, it also plays a role in the regulation of the transcription machinery. HSP90 and its co-chaperones modulate transcription at least at three different levels. They first alter the steady-state levels of certain transcription factors in response to various physiological cues. Second, they modulate the activity of certain epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylases or DNA methyl transferases, and thereby respond to the change in the environment. Third, they participate in the eviction of histones from the promoter region of certain genes and thereby turn on gene expression (PubMed:25973397). Antagonizes STUB1-mediated inhibition of TGF-beta signaling via inhibition of STUB1-mediated SMAD3 ubiquitination and degradation (PubMed:24613385). Promotes cell differentiation by chaperoning BIRC2 and thereby protecting from auto-ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasomal machinery (PubMed:18239673).

Can directly phosphorylate BAD and protects cells against apoptosis. Activated by interaction with CDC42 and RAC1. Functions as GTPase effector that links the Rho-related GTPases CDC42 and RAC1 to the JNK MAP kinase pathway. Phosphorylates and activates MAP2K1, and thereby mediates activation of downstream MAP kinases. Involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, actin stress fibers and of focal adhesion complexes. Phosphorylates the tubulin chaperone TBCB and thereby plays a role in the regulation of microtubule biogenesis and organization of the tubulin cytoskeleton. Plays a role in the regulation of insulin secretion in response to elevated glucose levels. Part of a ternary complex that contains PAK1, DVL1 and MUSK that is important for MUSK-dependent regulation of AChR clustering during the formation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Activity is inhibited in cells undergoing apoptosis, potentially due to binding of CDC2L1 and CDC2L2. Phosphorylates MYL9/MLC2. Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-338' and 'Ser-339' resulting in: activation of RAF1, stimulation of RAF1 translocation to mitochondria, phosphorylation of BAD by RAF1, and RAF1 binding to BCL2. Phosphorylates SNAI1 at 'Ser-246' promoting its transcriptional repressor activity by increasing its accumulation in the nucleus. In podocytes, promotes NR3C2 nuclear localization. Required for atypical chemokine receptor ACKR2-induced phosphorylation of LIMK1 and cofilin (CFL1) and for the up-regulation of ACKR2 from endosomal compartment to cell membrane, increasing its efficiency in chemokine uptake and degradation. In synapses, seems to mediate the regulation of F-actin cluster formation performed by SHANK3, maybe through CFL1 phosphorylation and inactivation. Plays a role in RUFY3-mediated facilitating gastric cancer cells migration and invasion (PubMed:25766321).

FC00149	P24928	DNA-directed RNA polymerase II subunit RPB1	Tudor domain-containing protein 3	NMR	456-490	DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Largest and catalytic component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Forms the polymerase active center together with the second largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. It is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. RPB1 is part of the core element with the central large cleft, the clamp element that moves to open and close the cleft and the jaws that are thought to grab the incoming DNA template. At the start of transcription, a single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned within the central active site cleft of Pol II. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. During transcription elongation, Pol II moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Elongation is influenced by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit (RPB1), which serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing. Regulation of gene expression levels depends on the balance between methylation and acetylation levels of tha CTD-lysines (By similarity). Initiation or early elongation steps of transcription of growth-factors-induced immediate early genes are regulated by the acetylation status of the CTD (PubMed:24207025).

FC00152	P48025	Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK	Proto-oncogene vav	NMR		Non-receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates signal transduction downstream of a variety of transmembrane receptors including classical immunoreceptors like the B-cell receptor (BCR). Regulates several biological processes including innate and adaptive immunity, cell adhesion, osteoclast maturation, platelet activation and vascular development. Assembles into signaling complexes with activated receptors at the plasma membrane via interaction between its SH2 domains and the receptor tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM domains. The association with the receptor can also be indirect and mediated by adapter proteins containing ITAM or partial hemITAM domains. The phosphorylation of the ITAM domains is generally mediated by SRC subfamily kinases upon engagement of the receptor. More rarely signal transduction via SYK could be ITAM-independent. Direct downstream effectors phosphorylated by SYK include VAV1, PLCG1, PI-3-kinase, LCP2 and BLNK. Initially identified as essential in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, it is necessary for the maturation of B-cells most probably at the pro-B to pre-B transition. Activated upon BCR engagement, it phosphorylates and activates BLNK an adapter linking the activated BCR to downstream signaling adapters and effectors. It also phosphorylates and activates PLCG1 and the PKC signaling pathway. It also phosphorylates BTK and regulates its activity in B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-coupled signaling. In addition to its function downstream of BCR plays also a role in T-cell receptor signaling. Plays also a crucial role in the innate immune response to fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens. It is for instance activated by the membrane lectin CLEC7A. Upon stimulation by fungal proteins, CLEC7A together with SYK activates immune cells inducing the production of ROS. Also activates the inflammasome and NF-kappa-B-mediated transcription of chemokines and cytokines in presence of pathogens. Regulates neutrophil degranulation and phagocytosis through activation of the MAPK signaling cascade. Required for the stimulation of neutrophil phagocytosis by IL15 (By similarity). Also mediates the activation of dendritic cells by cell necrosis stimuli. Also involved in mast cells activation. Involved in interleukin-3/IL3-mediated signaling pathway in basophils (PubMed:19098920). Also functions downstream of receptors mediating cell adhesion. Relays for instance, integrin-mediated neutrophils and macrophages activation and P-selectin receptor/SELPG-mediated recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory loci. Plays also a role in non-immune processes. It is for instance involved in vascular development where it may regulate blood and lymphatic vascular separation. It is also required for osteoclast development and function. Functions in the activation of platelets by collagen, mediating PLCG2 phosphorylation and activation. May be coupled to the collagen receptor by the ITAM domain-containing FCER1G. Also activated by the membrane lectin CLEC1B that is required for activation of platelets by PDPN/podoplanin. Involved in platelet adhesion being activated by ITGB3 engaged by fibrinogen. Together with CEACAM20, enhances production of the cytokine CXCL8/IL-8 via the NFKB pathway and may thus have a role in the intestinal immune response (PubMed:26195794)			 region remain disordered in the complex, with Proto-oncogene vav based on NMR data.	pdb:2lct		Fuzzy interactions intertwinned with loop fluctuations facilitating recognition of specific pTyr patterns and modulate binding affinity, thus affecting B-cell signaling.In addition, they may mediate allosteric communication with other SH2 domains.

FC00162	P43405	Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK	Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK	NMR	334-502	Non-receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates signal transduction downstream of a variety of transmembrane receptors including classical immunoreceptors like the B-cell receptor (BCR). Regulates several biological processes including innate and adaptive immunity, cell adhesion, osteoclast maturation, platelet activation and vascular development. Assembles into signaling complexes with activated receptors at the plasma membrane via interaction between its SH2 domains and the receptor tyrosine-phosphorylated ITAM domains. The association with the receptor can also be indirect and mediated by adapter proteins containing ITAM or partial hemITAM domains. The phosphorylation of the ITAM domains is generally mediated by SRC subfamily kinases upon engagement of the receptor. More rarely signal transduction via SYK could be ITAM-independent. Direct downstream effectors phosphorylated by SYK include VAV1, PLCG1, PI-3-kinase, LCP2 and BLNK. Initially identified as essential in B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, it is necessary for the maturation of B-cells most probably at the pro-B to pre-B transition. Activated upon BCR engagement, it phosphorylates and activates BLNK an adapter linking the activated BCR to downstream signaling adapters and effectors. It also phosphorylates and activates PLCG1 and the PKC signaling pathway. It also phosphorylates BTK and regulates its activity in B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-coupled signaling. In addition to its function downstream of BCR plays also a role in T-cell receptor signaling. Plays also a crucial role in the innate immune response to fungal, bacterial and viral pathogens. It is for instance activated by the membrane lectin CLEC7A. Upon stimulation by fungal proteins, CLEC7A together with SYK activates immune cells inducing the production of ROS. Also activates the inflammasome and NF-kappa-B-mediated transcription of chemokines and cytokines in presence of pathogens. Regulates neutrophil degranulation and phagocytosis through activation of the MAPK signaling cascade (By similarity). Required for the stimulation of neutrophil phagocytosis by IL15 (PubMed:15123770). Also mediates the activation of dendritic cells by cell necrosis stimuli. Also involved in mast cells activation. Involved in interleukin-3/IL3-mediated signaling pathway in basophils (By similarity). Also functions downstream of receptors mediating cell adhesion. Relays for instance, integrin-mediated neutrophils and macrophages activation and P-selectin receptor/SELPG-mediated recruitment of leukocytes to inflammatory loci. Plays also a role in non-immune processes. It is for instance involved in vascular development where it may regulate blood and lymphatic vascular separation. It is also required for osteoclast development and function. Functions in the activation of platelets by collagen, mediating PLCG2 phosphorylation and activation. May be coupled to the collagen receptor by the ITAM domain-containing FCER1G. Also activated by the membrane lectin CLEC1B that is required for activation of platelets by PDPN/podoplanin. Involved in platelet adhesion being activated by ITGB3 engaged by fibrinogen. Together with CEACAM20, enhances production of the cytokine CXCL8/IL-8 via the NFKB pathway and may thus have a role in the intestinal immune response (By similarity)			334-502 region remain disordered in the complex, with Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK based on NMR data.	pdb:1csy		Fuzzy interactions control binding affinity and selectivity of phosphotyrosine activation motifs of immunoglobuline receptors.

FC00166	P04608	Protein Tat	Protein Tat	NMR	44-60	Nuclear transcriptional activator of viral gene expression, that is essential for viral transcription from the LTR promoter and replication. Acts as a sequence-specific molecular adapter, directing components of the cellular transcription machinery to the viral RNA to promote processive transcription elongation by the RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) complex, thereby increasing the level of full-length transcripts. In the absence of Tat, the RNA Pol II generates short or non-processive transcripts that terminate at approximately 60 bp from the initiation site. Tat associates with the CCNT1/cyclin-T1 component of the P-TEFb complex (CDK9 and CCNT1), which promotes RNA chain elongation. This binding increases Tat's affinity for a hairpin structure at the 5'-end of all nascent viral mRNAs referred to as the transactivation responsive RNA element (TAR RNA) and allows Tat/P-TEFb complex to bind cooperatively to TAR RNA. The CDK9 component of P-TEFb and other Tat-activated kinases hyperphosphorylate the C-terminus of RNA Pol II that becomes stabilized and much more processive. Other factors such as HTATSF1/Tat-SF1, SUPT5H/SPT5, and HTATIP2 are also important for Tat's function. Besides its effect on RNA Pol II processivity, Tat induces chromatin remodeling of proviral genes by recruiting the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) CREBBP, EP300 and PCAF to the chromatin. This also contributes to the increase in proviral transcription rate, especially when the provirus integrates in transcriptionally silent region of the host genome. To ensure maximal activation of the LTR, Tat mediates nuclear translocation of NF-kappa-B by interacting with host RELA. Through its interaction with host TBP, Tat may also modulate transcription initiation. Tat can reactivate a latently infected cell by penetrating in it and transactivating its LTR promoter. In the cytoplasm, Tat is thought to act as a translational activator of HIV-1 mRNAsExtracellular circulating Tat can be endocytosed by surrounding uninfected cells via the binding to several surface receptors such as CD26, CXCR4, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) or LDLR. Neurons are rarely infected, but they internalize Tat via their LDLR. Through its interaction with nuclear HATs, Tat is potentially able to control the acetylation-dependent cellular gene expression. Modulates the expression of many cellular genes involved in cell survival, proliferation or in coding for cytokines or cytokine receptors. Tat plays a role in T-cell and neurons apoptosis. Tat induced neurotoxicity and apoptosis probably contribute to neuroAIDS. Circulating Tat also acts as a chemokine-like and/or growth factor-like molecule that binds to specific receptors on the surface of the cells, affecting many cellular pathways. In the vascular system, Tat binds to ITGAV/ITGB3 and ITGA5/ITGB1 integrins dimers at the surface of endothelial cells and competes with bFGF for heparin-binding sites, leading to an excess of soluble bFGF			44-60 region remain disordered in the complex, with Protein Tat based on NMR data.	pdb:6mcf, pdb:6mce		Fuzzy interactions enable a switch-and-replace mechanism between competing partners of cellular and host proteins via promoting conformational changes in the bound complex.

FC00172	Q15054	DNA polymerase delta subunit 3	DNA repair protein REV1	NMR		Accessory component of both the DNA polymerase delta complex and the DNA polymerase zeta complex (PubMed:22801543, PubMed:17317665, PubMed:24449906). As a component of the trimeric and tetrameric DNA polymerase delta complexes (Pol-delta3 and Pol-delta4, respectively), plays a role in high fidelity genome replication, including in lagging strand synthesis, and repair. Required for optimal Pol-delta activity. Stabilizes the Pol-delta complex and plays a major role in Pol-delta stimulation by PCNA (PubMed:10219083, PubMed:10852724, PubMed:11595739, PubMed:16510448, PubMed:24035200). Pol-delta3 and Pol-delta4 are characterized by the absence or the presence of POLD4. They exhibit differences in catalytic activity. Most notably, Pol-delta3 shows higher proofreading activity than Pol-delta4 (PubMed:19074196, PubMed:20334433). Although both Pol-delta3 and Pol-delta4 process Okazaki fragments in vitro, Pol-delta3 may also be better suited to fulfill this task, exhibiting near-absence of strand displacement activity compared to Pol-delta4 and stalling on encounter with the 5'-blocking oligonucleotides. Pol-delta3 idling process may avoid the formation of a gap, while maintaining a nick that can be readily ligated (PubMed:24035200). Along with DNA polymerase kappa, DNA polymerase delta carries out approximately half of nucleotide excision repair (NER) synthesis following UV irradiation. In this context, POLD3, along with PCNA and RFC1-replication factor C complex, is required to recruit POLD1, the catalytic subunit of the polymerase delta complex, to DNA damage sites (PubMed:20227374). Under conditions of DNA replication stress, required for the repair of broken replication forks through break-induced replication (BIR) (PubMed:24310611). Involved in the translesion synthesis (TLS) of templates carrying O6-methylguanine or abasic sites performed by Pol-delta4, independently of DNA polymerase zeta (REV3L) or eta (POLH). Facilitates abasic site bypass by DNA polymerase delta by promoting extension from the nucleotide inserted opposite the lesion (PubMed:19074196, PubMed:25628356, PubMed:27185888). Also involved in TLS, as a component of the tetrametric DNA polymerase zeta complex. Along with POLD2, dramatically increases the efficiency and processivity of DNA synthesis of the DNA polymerase zeta complex compared to the minimal zeta complex, consisting of only REV3L and REV7 (PubMed:24449906)			 region remain disordered in the complex, with DNA repair protein REV1 based on NMR data.	pdb:2n1g		Fuzzy interactions enable a functional switch via modulatinng the affinities of interactions with inserter and extender polymerases.

FC00173	P03355	Gag-Pol polyprotein	Gag-Pol polyprotein	NMR	211-255, 479-534, 479-533	Plays a role in budding and is processed by the viral protease during virion maturation outside the cell. During budding, it recruits, in a PPXY-dependent or independent manner, Nedd4-like ubiquitin ligases that conjugate ubiquitin molecules to Gag-Pol, or to Gag-Pol binding host factors. Interaction with HECT ubiquitin ligases probably links the viral protein to the host ESCRT pathway and facilitates releaseTargets Gag and gag-pol polyproteins to the plasma membrane via a multipartite membrane binding signal, that includes its myristoylated N-terminus. Also mediates nuclear localization of the pre-integration complexConstituent of the pre-integration complex (PIC) which tethers the latter to mitotic chromosomes. This allows the integration of the viral genome into the host DNAForms the spherical core of the virion that encapsulates the genomic RNA-nucleocapsid complexInvolved in the packaging and encapsidation of two copies of the genome (By similarity). Binds with high affinity to conserved UCUG elements within the packaging signal, located near the 5'-end of the genome (By similarity). This binding is dependent on genome dimerization (By similarity). Acts as a nucleic acid chaperone which is involved in rearrangement of nucleic acid secondary structures during gRNA retrotranscription (PubMed:25209668)The aspartyl protease mediates proteolytic cleavages of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins during or shortly after the release of the virion from the plasma membrane. Cleavages take place as an ordered, step-wise cascade to yield mature proteins. This process is called maturation. Displays maximal activity during the budding process just prior to particle release from the cell (Potential). Cleaves the translation initiation factor eIF4G leading to the inhibition of host cap-dependent translation (PubMed:14610163)RT is a multifunctional enzyme that converts the viral dimeric RNA genome into dsDNA in the cytoplasm, shortly after virus entry into the cell. This enzyme displays a DNA polymerase activity that can copy either DNA or RNA templates, and a ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity that cleaves the RNA strand of RNA-DNA heteroduplexes in a partially processive 3' to 5' endonucleasic mode. Conversion of viral genomic RNA into dsDNA requires many steps. A tRNA binds to the primer-binding site (PBS) situated at the 5' end of the viral RNA. RT uses the 3' end of the tRNA primer to perform a short round of RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis. The reading proceeds through the U5 region and ends after the repeated (R) region which is present at both ends of viral RNA. The portion of the RNA-DNA heteroduplex is digested by the RNase H, resulting in a ssDNA product attached to the tRNA primer. This ssDNA/tRNA hybridizes with the identical R region situated at the 3' end of viral RNA. This template exchange, known as minus-strand DNA strong stop transfer, can be either intra- or intermolecular. RT uses the 3' end of this newly synthesized short ssDNA to perform the RNA-dependent minus-strand DNA synthesis of the whole template. RNase H digests the RNA template except for a polypurine tract (PPT) situated at the 5' end of the genome. It is not clear if both polymerase and RNase H activities are simultaneous. RNase H probably can proceed both in a polymerase-dependent (RNA cut into small fragments by the same RT performing DNA synthesis) and a polymerase-independent mode (cleavage of remaining RNA fragments by free RTs). Secondly, RT performs DNA-directed plus-strand DNA synthesis using the PPT that has not been removed by RNase H as primers. PPT and tRNA primers are then removed by RNase H. The 3' and 5' ssDNA PBS regions hybridize to form a circular dsDNA intermediate. Strand displacement synthesis by RT to the PBS and PPT ends produces a blunt ended, linear dsDNA copy of the viral genome that includes long terminal repeats (LTRs) at both endsCatalyzes viral DNA integration into the host chromosome, by performing a series of DNA cutting and joining reactions. This enzyme activity takes place after virion entry into a cell and reverse transcription of the RNA genome in dsDNA. The first step in the integration process is 3' processing. This step requires a complex comprising the viral genome, matrix protein and integrase. This complex is called the pre-integration complex (PIC). The integrase protein removes 2 nucleotides from each 3' end of the viral DNA, leaving recessed CA OH's at the 3' ends. In the second step that requires cell division, the PIC enters cell nucleus. In the third step, termed strand transfer, the integrase protein joins the previously processed 3' ends to the 5' ends of strands of target cellular DNA at the site of integration. The last step is viral DNA integration into host chromosome			211-255, 479-534, 479-533 regions remain disordered in the complex, with Gag-Pol polyprotein based on NMR data.	pdb:2mqv, pdb:2ms0, pdb:2ms1		Fuzzy interactions enable an entropy-driven mechanism of chaperone activity to trigger residue-specific destabilization and release for RNA remodelling.

Phosphorylates TNNT2/cardiac muscle troponin T. Can promote NF-kB activation and inhibit signal transducers involved in motility (ROCK2), apoptosis (MAP3K5/ASK1 and STK3/MST2), proliferation and angiogenesis (RB1). Can protect cells from apoptosis also by translocating to the mitochondria where it binds BCL2 and displaces BAD/Bcl2-antagonist of cell death. Regulates Rho signaling and migration, and is required for normal wound healing. Plays a role in the oncogenic transformation of epithelial cells via repression of the TJ protein, occludin (OCLN) by inducing the up-regulation of a transcriptional repressor SNAI2/SLUG, which induces down-regulation of OCLN.

FC00207	P84092	AP-2 complex subunit mu	Adaptin ear-binding coat-associated protein 1	NMR	65-123	Component of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis (PubMed:14745134, PubMed:15473838). AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface (By similarity). AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules (PubMed:15985462). AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway (By similarity). During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (By similarity). The AP-2 mu (AP2M1) subunit binds to transmembrane cargo proteins; it recognizes the Y-X-X-Phi motifs (PubMed:15985462). The surface region interacting with to the Y-X-X-Phi motif is inaccessible in cytosolic AP-2, but becomes accessible through a conformational change following phosphorylation of AP-2 mu subunit at Thr-156 in membrane-associated AP-2 (PubMed:15985462, PubMed:11516654). The membrane-specific phosphorylation event appears to involve assembled clathrin which activates the AP-2 mu kinase AAK1 (By similarity). Plays a role in endocytosis of frizzled family members upon Wnt signaling (PubMed:20947020)			65-123 region remain disordered in the complex, with Adaptin ear-binding coat-associated protein 1 based on NMR data.	pdb:6rh6		Fuzzy interactions are coupled to the phosphorylation-modulated conformational change of AP-2, which regulate binding of different NECAP proteins.

Suppresses T-cell activation through the recruitment of PTPN11/SHP-2: following ligand-binding, PDCD1 is phosphorylated within the ITSM motif, leading to the recruitment of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPN11/SHP-2 that mediates dephosphorylation of key TCR proximal signaling molecules, such as ZAP70, PRKCQ/PKCtheta and CD247/CD3zeta (By similarity)The PDCD1-mediated inhibitory pathway is exploited by tumors to attenuate anti-tumor immunity and escape destruction by the immune system, thereby facilitating tumor survival (PubMed:28951311). The interaction with CD274/PDCD1L1 inhibits cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) effector function (PubMed:28951311). The blockage of the PDCD1-mediated pathway results in the reversal of the exhausted T-cell phenotype and the normalization of the anti-tumor response, providing a rationale for cancer immunotherapy (PubMed:22658127, PubMed:25034862, PubMed:25399552)			71-151 region remain disordered in the complex, with Tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 based on NMR data.	pdb:6r5g		Fuzzy interactions contribute to context-specific recognition of the phosphopeptide motifs, and cooperate binding of the tyrosine based inhibitory and switch motifs (ITIM and ITSM) to produce a stable open complex.

FC00229	Q01831	DNA repair protein complementing XP-C cells	General transcription factor IIH subunit 1	NMR		Involved in global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) by acting as damage sensing and DNA-binding factor component of the XPC complex (PubMed:10734143, PubMed:19609301, PubMed:20649465, PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). Has only a low DNA repair activity by itself which is stimulated by RAD23B and RAD23A. Has a preference to bind DNA containing a short single-stranded segment but not to damaged oligonucleotides (PubMed:10734143, PubMed:19609301, PubMed:20649465). This feature is proposed to be related to a dynamic sensor function: XPC can rapidly screen duplex DNA for non-hydrogen-bonded bases by forming a transient nucleoprotein intermediate complex which matures into a stable recognition complex through an intrinsic single-stranded DNA-binding activity (PubMed:10734143, PubMed:19609301, PubMed:20649465). The XPC complex is proposed to represent the first factor bound at the sites of DNA damage and together with other core recognition factors, XPA, RPA and the TFIIH complex, is part of the pre-incision (or initial recognition) complex (PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). The XPC complex recognizes a wide spectrum of damaged DNA characterized by distortions of the DNA helix such as single-stranded loops, mismatched bubbles or single-stranded overhangs (PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). The orientation of XPC complex binding appears to be crucial for inducing a productive NER (PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). XPC complex is proposed to recognize and to interact with unpaired bases on the undamaged DNA strand which is followed by recruitment of the TFIIH complex and subsequent scanning for lesions in the opposite strand in a 5'-to-3' direction by the NER machinery (PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) which are formed upon UV-induced DNA damage esacpe detection by the XPC complex due to a low degree of structural perurbation. Instead they are detected by the UV-DDB complex which in turn recruits and cooperates with the XPC complex in the respective DNA repair (PubMed:9734359, PubMed:10873465, PubMed:12509299, PubMed:12547395, PubMed:19941824, PubMed:20028083, PubMed:20798892). In vitro, the XPC:RAD23B dimer is sufficient to initiate NER; it preferentially binds to cisplatin and UV-damaged double-stranded DNA and also binds to a variety of chemically and structurally diverse DNA adducts (PubMed:20028083). XPC:RAD23B contacts DNA both 5' and 3' of a cisplatin lesion with a preference for the 5' side. XPC:RAD23B induces a bend in DNA upon binding. XPC:RAD23B stimulates the activity of DNA glycosylases TDG and SMUG1 (PubMed:20028083)In absence of DNA repair, the XPC complex also acts as a transcription coactivator: XPC interacts with the DNA-binding transcription factor E2F1 at a subset of promoters to recruit KAT2A and histone acetyltransferase complexes (HAT) (PubMed:29973595, PubMed:31527837). KAT2A recruitment specifically promotes acetylation of histone variant H2A.Z.1/H2A.Z, but not H2A.Z.2/H2A.V, thereby promoting expression of target genes (PubMed:31527837)		PhaSepDB:Q01831	 region remain disordered in the complex, with General transcription factor IIH subunit 1 based on NMR data.	pdb:2rvb		Fuzzy interactions facilitate binding mode divergence for different targets (XPC, TFIIE, p53), which target the same binding site.

FC00254	P26554	Protein E6	Disks large homolog 1	NMR		Plays a major role in the induction and maintenance of cellular transformation. Acts mainly as an oncoprotein by stimulating the destruction of many host cell key regulatory proteins. E6 associates with host UBE3A/E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase, and inactivates tumor suppressors TP53 and TP73 by targeting them to the 26S proteasome for degradation. In turn, DNA damage and chromosomal instabilities increase and lead to cell proliferation and cancer development. The complex E6/E6AP targets several other substrates to degradation via the proteasome including host DLG1 or NFX1, a repressor of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). The resulting increased expression of hTERT prevents the shortening of telomere length leading to cell immortalization. Other cellular targets including BAK1, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD) and procaspase 8, are degraded by E6/E6AP causing inhibition of apoptosis. E6 also inhibits immune response by interacting with host IRF3 and TYK2. These interactions prevent IRF3 transcriptional activities and inhibit TYK2-mediated JAK-STAT activation by interferon alpha resulting in inhibition of the interferon signaling pathway			 region remain disordered in the complex, with Disks large homolog 1 based on NMR data.	pdb:2m3m		Fuzzy interactions enhance affinity and enable specific recognition of different E6 proteins.

Undergoes a functional cycle that is linked to its ATPase activity.

Binding of ATP induces large conformational changes, resulting in the formation of a ring-like closed structure in which the N-terminal domains associate intramolecularly with the middle domain and also dimerize with each other, stimulating their intrinsic ATPase activity and acting as a clamp on the substrate. Finally, ATP hydrolysis results in the release of the substrate. This cycle probably induces conformational changes in the client proteins, thereby causing their activation.

FC00283	P19483	ATP synthase subunit alpha, mitochondrial	ATP synthase subunit O, mitochondrial	NMR		Mitochondrial membrane ATP synthase (F(1)F(0) ATP synthase or Complex V) produces ATP from ADP in the presence of a proton gradient across the membrane which is generated by electron transport complexes of the respiratory chain. F-type ATPases consist of two structural domains, F(1) - containing the extramembraneous catalytic core, and F(0) - containing the membrane proton channel, linked together by a central stalk and a peripheral stalk. During catalysis, ATP synthesis in the catalytic domain of F(1) is coupled via a rotary mechanism of the central stalk subunits to proton translocation. Subunits alpha and beta form the catalytic core in F(1). Rotation of the central stalk against the surrounding alpha(3)beta(3) subunits leads to hydrolysis of ATP in three separate catalytic sites on the beta subunits. Subunit alpha does not bear the catalytic high-affinity ATP-binding sites.

The receptor systems for IL6, LIF, OSM, CNTF, IL11, CTF1 and BSF3 can utilize IL6ST for initiating signal transmission. Binding of IL6 to IL6R induces IL6ST homodimerization and formation of a high-affinity receptor complex, which activate the intracellular JAK-MAPK and JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways (PubMed:1602143, PubMed:10661409). That causes phosphorylation of IL6ST tyrosine residues which in turn activates STAT3 (PubMed:10661409). In parallel, the IL6 signaling pathway induces the expression of two cytokine receptor signaling inhibitors, SOCS1 and SOCS3, which inhibit JAK and terminate the activity of the IL6 signaling pathway as a negative feedback loop (PubMed:9202125). Also activates the yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and NOTCH pathways to control inflammation-induced epithelial regeneration, independently of STAT3 (PubMed:25731159).

Associates non-covalently with TGF-beta-1 and regulates its activation via interaction with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1, LRRC32/GARP and LRRC33/NRROS, that control activation of TGF-beta-1 (PubMed:2022183, PubMed:8617200, PubMed:8939931, PubMed:19750484, PubMed:22278742, PubMed:19651619). Interaction with LRRC33/NRROS regulates activation of TGF-beta-1 in macrophages and microglia (Probable). Interaction with LRRC32/GARP controls activation of TGF-beta-1 on the surface of activated regulatory T-cells (Tregs) (PubMed:19750484, PubMed:22278742, PubMed:19651619). Interaction with integrins (ITGAV:ITGB6 or ITGAV:ITGB8) results in distortion of the Latency-associated peptide chain and subsequent release of the active TGF-beta-1 (PubMed:22278742, PubMed:28117447)Multifunctional protein that regulates the growth and differentiation of various cell types and is involved in various processes, such as normal development, immune function, microglia function and responses to neurodegeneration (By similarity). Activation into mature form follows different steps: following cleavage of the proprotein in the Golgi apparatus, Latency-associated peptide (LAP) and Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta-1) chains remain non-covalently linked rendering TGF-beta-1 inactive during storage in extracellular matrix (PubMed:29109152). At the same time, LAP chain interacts with 'milieu molecules', such as LTBP1, LRRC32/GARP and LRRC33/NRROS that control activation of TGF-beta-1 and maintain it in a latent state during storage in extracellular milieus (PubMed:2022183, PubMed:8617200, PubMed:8939931, PubMed:19750484, PubMed:22278742, PubMed:19651619). TGF-beta-1 is released from LAP by integrins (ITGAV:ITGB6 or ITGAV:ITGB8): integrin-binding to LAP stabilizes an alternative conformation of the LAP bowtie tail and results in distortion of the LAP chain and subsequent release of the active TGF-beta-1 (PubMed:22278742, PubMed:28117447). Once activated following release of LAP, TGF-beta-1 acts by binding to TGF-beta receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), which transduce signal (PubMed:20207738). While expressed by many cells types, TGF-beta-1 only has a very localized range of action within cell environment thanks to fine regulation of its activation by Latency-associated peptide chain (LAP) and 'milieu molecules' (By similarity). Plays an important role in bone remodeling: acts as a potent stimulator of osteoblastic bone formation, causing chemotaxis, proliferation and differentiation in committed osteoblasts (By similarity). Can promote either T-helper 17 cells (Th17) or regulatory T-cells (Treg) lineage differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner (By similarity). At high concentrations, leads to FOXP3-mediated suppression of RORC and down-regulation of IL-17 expression, favoring Treg cell development (By similarity). At low concentrations in concert with IL-6 and IL-21, leads to expression of the IL-17 and IL-23 receptors, favoring differentiation to Th17 cells (By similarity). Stimulates sustained production of collagen through the activation of CREB3L1 by regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) (PubMed:25310401). Mediates SMAD2/3 activation by inducing its phosphorylation and subsequent translocation to the nucleus (PubMed:25893292, PubMed:29483653, PubMed:30696809). Can induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration in various cell types (PubMed:25893292, PubMed:30696809)			290-301, 279-390 regions remain disordered in the complex, with Transforming growth factor beta-1 proprotein based on NMR data.	pdb:1kld		Fuzzy interactions contribute to growth hormon inhibition and contribute to functional differences between TGF-b1 and TGF-b2 isoforms.

EnvZ functions as a membrane-associated protein kinase that phosphorylates OmpR in response to environmental signals; at low osmolarity OmpR activates ompF transcription, while at high osmolarity it represses ompF and activates ompC transcription (PubMed:2656684, PubMed:2668281, PubMed:2668953, PubMed:2674113, PubMed:2558046, PubMed:2277041, PubMed:1323560). Also dephosphorylates OmpR in the presence of ATP (PubMed:2668281, PubMed:2558046, PubMed:2277041, PubMed:1323560). The cytoplasmic dimerization domain (CDD) forms an osmosensitive core; increasing osmolarity stabilizes this segment (possibly by its contraction), enhancing the autophosphorylation rate and consequently, downstream phosphotransfer to OmpR and signaling (PubMed:22543870, PubMed:28256224). Autophosphorylation is greater when full-length EnvZ is reconstituted in a lipid environment, lipid-mediated allostery impacts the kinase function of EnvZ (PubMed:28256224).

FC00318	P05866	Protein Rev	Protein Rev	NMR	7-29, 80-90	Escorts unspliced or incompletely spliced viral pre-mRNAs (late transcripts) out of the nucleus of infected cells. These pre-mRNAs carry a recognition sequence called Rev responsive element (RRE) located in the env gene, that is not present in fully spliced viral mRNAs (early transcripts). This function is essential since most viral proteins are translated from unspliced or partially spliced pre-mRNAs which cannot exit the nucleus by the pathway used by fully processed cellular mRNAs. Rev itself is translated from a fully spliced mRNA that readily exits the nucleus. Rev's nuclear localization signal (NLS) binds directly to KPNB1/Importin beta-1 without previous binding to KPNA1/Importin alpha-1. KPNB1 binds to the GDP bound form of RAN (Ran-GDP) and targets Rev to the nucleus. In the nucleus, the conversion from Ran-GDP to Ran-GTP dissociates Rev from KPNB1 and allows Rev's binding to the RRE in viral pre-mRNAs. Rev multimerization on the RRE via cooperative assembly exposes its nuclear export signal (NES) to the surface. Rev can then form a complex with XPO1/CRM1 and Ran-GTP, leading to nuclear export of the complex. Conversion from Ran-GTP to Ran-GDP mediates dissociation of the Rev/RRE/XPO1/RAN complex, so that Rev can return to the nucleus for a subsequent round of export. Beside KPNB1, also seems to interact with TNPO1/Transportin-1, RANBP5/IPO5 and IPO7/RANBP7 for nuclear import. The nucleoporin-like HRB/RIP is an essential cofactor that probably indirectly interacts with Rev to release HIV RNAs from the perinuclear region to the cytoplasm (By similarity)			7-29, 80-90 regions remain disordered in the complex, with Protein Rev based on NMR data.	pdb:1etg, pdb:1ull		Fuzzy interactions contribute to adaptive binding of the RNA major groove by shape-recognition.

FC00319	Q61036	Serine/threonine-protein kinase PAK 3	Cell division control protein 42 homolog	NMR	311-316, 65-92	Serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a role in a variety of different signaling pathways including cytoskeleton regulation, cell migration, or cell cycle regulation. Plays a role in dendrite spine morphogenesis as well as synapse formation and plasticity (PubMed:25851601). Acts as downstream effector of the small GTPases CDC42 and RAC1. Activation by the binding of active CDC42 and RAC1 results in a conformational change and a subsequent autophosphorylation on several serine and/or threonine residues. Phosphorylates MAPK4 and MAPK6 and activates the downstream target MAPKAPK5, a regulator of F-actin polymerization and cell migration. Additionally, phosphorylates TNNI3/troponin I to modulate calcium sensitivity and relaxation kinetics of thin myofilaments. May also be involved in early neuronal development			311-316, 65-92 regions remain disordered in the complex, with Cell division control protein 42 homolog based on NMR data.	pdb:1ees		Fuzzy interactions facilitate coordinated binding of the two switch regions of Cdc42Hs, affecting the conformation of Q61 thus leading to inhibition of GTP hydrolysis.

FC00357	P04578	Envelope glycoprotein gp160	Envelope glycoprotein gp160	NMR	677-788, 677-788, 677-788	Oligomerizes in the host endoplasmic reticulum into predominantly trimers. In a second time, gp160 transits in the host Golgi, where glycosylation is completed. The precursor is then proteolytically cleaved in the trans-Golgi and thereby activated by cellular furin or furin-like proteases to produce gp120 and gp41Attaches the virus to the host lymphoid cell by binding to the primary receptor CD4. This interaction induces a structural rearrangement creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine coreceptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5. Acts as a ligand for CD209/DC-SIGN and CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR, which are respectively found on dendritic cells (DCs), and on endothelial cells of liver sinusoids and lymph node sinuses. These interactions allow capture of viral particles at mucosal surfaces by these cells and subsequent transmission to permissive cells. HIV subverts the migration properties of dendritic cells to gain access to CD4+ T-cells in lymph nodes. Virus transmission to permissive T-cells occurs either in trans (without DCs infection, through viral capture and transmission), or in cis (following DCs productive infection, through the usual CD4-gp120 interaction), thereby inducing a robust infection. In trans infection, bound virions remain infectious over days and it is proposed that they are not degraded, but protected in non-lysosomal acidic organelles within the DCs close to the cell membrane thus contributing to the viral infectious potential during DCs' migration from the periphery to the lymphoid tissues. On arrival at lymphoid tissues, intact virions recycle back to DCs' cell surface allowing virus transmission to CD4+ T-cellsActs as a class I viral fusion protein. Under the current model, the protein has at least 3 conformational states: pre-fusion native state, pre-hairpin intermediate state, and post-fusion hairpin state. During fusion of viral and target intracellular membranes, the coiled coil regions (heptad repeats) assume a trimer-of-hairpins structure, positioning the fusion peptide in close proximity to the C-terminal region of the ectodomain. The formation of this structure appears to drive apposition and subsequent fusion of viral and target cell membranes. Complete fusion occurs in host cell endosomes and is dynamin-dependent, however some lipid transfer might occur at the plasma membrane. The virus undergoes clathrin-dependent internalization long before endosomal fusion, thus minimizing the surface exposure of conserved viral epitopes during fusion and reducing the efficacy of inhibitors targeting these epitopes. Membranes fusion leads to delivery of the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm			677-788, 677-788, 677-788 regions remain disordered in the complex, with Envelope glycoprotein gp160 based on NMR data.	pdb:6uju		Fuzzy interactions facilitate dynamic coupling between the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail.

In the MLL1/MLL complex, it specifically mediates H3K4me, a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation (PubMed:15960975, PubMed:12453419, PubMed:15960975, PubMed:19556245, PubMed:19187761, PubMed:20677832, PubMed:21220120, PubMed:26886794). Has weak methyltransferase activity by itself, and requires other component of the MLL1/MLL complex to obtain full methyltransferase activity (PubMed:19187761, PubMed:26886794). Has no activity toward histone H3 phosphorylated on 'Thr-3', less activity toward H3 dimethylated on 'Arg-8' or 'Lys-9', while it has higher activity toward H3 acetylated on 'Lys-9' (PubMed:19187761). Binds to unmethylated CpG elements in the promoter of target genes and helps maintain them in the nonmethylated state (PubMed:20010842). Required for transcriptional activation of HOXA9 (PubMed:12453419, PubMed:20677832, PubMed:20010842). Promotes PPP1R15A-induced apoptosis (PubMed:10490642). Plays a critical role in the control of circadian gene expression and is essential for the transcriptional activation mediated by the CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 heterodimer (By similarity). Establishes a permissive chromatin state for circadian transcription by mediating a rhythmic methylation of 'Lys-4' of histone H3 (H3K4me) and this histone modification directs the circadian acetylation at H3K9 and H3K14 allowing the recruitment of CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 to chromatin (By similarity). Also has auto-methylation activity on Cys-3882 in absence of histone H3 substrate (PubMed:24235145)			140-160 region remain disordered in the complex, with PC4 and SFRS1-interacting protein based on NMR data.	pdb:2msr		Fuzzy interactions enable selective recognition of MLL via multiple contact sites.

Interaction between APP molecules on neighboring cells promotes synaptogenesis (PubMed:25122912). Involved in cell mobility and transcription regulation through protein-protein interactions. Can promote transcription activation through binding to APBB1-KAT5 and inhibits Notch signaling through interaction with Numb. Couples to apoptosis-inducing pathways such as those mediated by G(O) and JIP. Inhibits G(o) alpha ATPase activity (By similarity). Acts as a kinesin I membrane receptor, mediating the axonal transport of beta-secretase and presenilin 1 (By similarity). By acting as a kinesin I membrane receptor, plays a role in axonal anterograde transport of cargo towards synapes in axons (PubMed:17062754, PubMed:23011729). Involved in copper homeostasis/oxidative stress through copper ion reduction. In vitro, copper-metallated APP induces neuronal death directly or is potentiated through Cu(2+)-mediated low-density lipoprotein oxidation. Can regulate neurite outgrowth through binding to components of the extracellular matrix such as heparin and collagen I and IV. The splice isoforms that contain the BPTI domain possess protease inhibitor activity. Induces a AGER-dependent pathway that involves activation of p38 MAPK, resulting in internalization of amyloid-beta peptide and leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured cortical neurons. Provides Cu(2+) ions for GPC1 which are required for release of nitric oxide (NO) and subsequent degradation of the heparan sulfate chains on GPC1Amyloid-beta peptides are lipophilic metal chelators with metal-reducing activity. Bind transient metals such as copper, zinc and iron. In vitro, can reduce Cu(2+) and Fe(3+) to Cu(+) and Fe(2+), respectively. Amyloid-beta protein 42 is a more effective reductant than amyloid-beta protein 40. Amyloid-beta peptides bind to lipoproteins and apolipoproteins E and J in the CSF and to HDL particles in plasma, inhibiting metal-catalyzed oxidation of lipoproteins. APP42-beta may activate mononuclear phagocytes in the brain and elicit inflammatory responses. Promotes both tau aggregation and TPK II-mediated phosphorylation. Interaction with overexpressed HADH2 leads to oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Also binds GPC1 in lipid raftsAppicans elicit adhesion of neural cells to the extracellular matrix and may regulate neurite outgrowth in the brainThe gamma-CTF peptides as well as the caspase-cleaved peptides, including C31, are potent enhancers of neuronal apoptosisN-APP binds TNFRSF21 triggering caspase activation and degeneration of both neuronal cell bodies (via caspase-3) and axons (via caspase-6)	Functions as a cell surface receptor and performs physiological functions on the surface of neurons relevant to neurite growth, neuronal adhesion and axonogenesis.

When covalently bound, it is conjugated to target proteins via an isopeptide bond either as a monomer (monoubiquitin), a polymer linked via different Lys residues of the ubiquitin (polyubiquitin chains) or a linear polymer linked via the initiator Met of the ubiquitin (linear polyubiquitin chains). Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling. Ubiquitin is usually conjugated to Lys residues of target proteins, however, in rare cases, conjugation to Cys or Ser residues has been observed.

Forms a heterodimeric receptor with SORCS2 that binds the precursor forms of NGF, BDNF and NTF3 with high affinity, and has much lower affinity for mature NGF and BDNF (PubMed:24908487, PubMed:22155786). In response to proNGF binding, the heterodimeric receptor with SORCS2 activates a signaling cascade that leads to decreased Rac activity, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and neuronal growth cone collapse (PubMed:22155786). Plays an important role in differentiation and survival of specific neuronal populations during development (By similarity). Can mediate cell survival as well as cell death of neural cells (PubMed:10514511, PubMed:10985348, PubMed:24908487). Plays a role in the inactivation of RHOA (By similarity). Plays a role in the regulation of the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface in adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells in response to insulin, probably by regulating RAB31 activity, and thereby contributes to the regulation of insulin-dependent glucose uptake (By similarity).

Post-transcriptionally represses the expression of genes controlled by GacA/GacS (PubMed:15601712, PubMed:23635605). Binds the 5' UTR of mRNA; the mRNA binds to the outside edge to each monomer and each dimer could bind the same mRNA twice (PubMed:17704818). Recognizes a (A/U)CANGGANG(U/A) consensus, binds to GGA (part of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence) in the 5' UTR loop, which prevents ribosome binding (PubMed:17704818, PubMed:24561806, PubMed:23635605). Overexpression represses target protein expression; mutating nucleotides in the 5' UTR abolishes repression in vivo (PubMed:17704818, PubMed:23635605). Binds specifically to small RNAs (sRNA) RsmX, RsmZ and RsmY; these sRNAs fold into secondary structures with multiple GGA sequences in loops to which the CsrA proteins bind (PubMed:15601712, PubMed:16286659, PubMed:24828038). Binding to RsmX, RsmY or RsmZ titrates the protein so that it can no longer bind mRNA and repress translation (PubMed:15601712, PubMed:24828038).

Polyubiquitin chains, when attached to a target protein, have different functions depending on the Lys residue of the ubiquitin that is linked: Lys-6-linked may be involved in DNA repair; Lys-11-linked is involved in ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation) and in cell-cycle regulation; Lys-29-linked is involved in lysosomal degradation; Lys-33-linked is involved in kinase modification; Lys-48-linked is involved in protein degradation via the proteasome; Lys-63-linked is involved in endocytosis, DNA-damage responses as well as in signaling processes leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa-B. Linear polymer chains formed via attachment by the initiator Met lead to cell signaling.

The p24 protein family is a group of transmembrane proteins that bind coat protein complex I/COPI and coat protein complex II/COPII involved in vesicular trafficking between the membranes (By similarity). Acts at the lumenal side for incorporation of secretory cargo molecules into transport vesicles and involved in vesicle coat formation at the cytoplasmic side. Mainly functions in the early secretory pathway and cycles between the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and Golgi, mediating cargo transport through COPI and COPII-coated vesicles (PubMed:9990005, PubMed:9813083). In COPII vesicle-mediated anterograde transport, involved in the transport of GPI-anchored proteins by acting together with TMED2 as their cargo receptor; the function specifically implies SEC24C and SEC24D of the COPII vesicle coat and lipid raft-like microdomains of the ER (By similarity). Recognizes GPI anchors structural remodeled in the ER by the GPI inositol-deacylase/PGAP1 and the metallophosphoesterase MPPE1/PGAP5 (By similarity). In COPI vesicle-mediated retrograde transport, involved in the biogenesis of COPI vesicles and vesicle coat recruitment (PubMed:9990005, PubMed:9813083, PubMed:18182008). Involved in trafficking of amyloid beta A4 protein and soluble APP-beta release (independent from the modulation of gamma-secretase activity) (By similarity). Involved in the KDELR2-mediated retrograde transport of the toxin A subunit (CTX-A-K63)together with COPI and the COOH terminus of KDELR2 (PubMed:9813083). On Golgi membranes, acts as primary receptor for ARF1-GDP, a GTP-binding protein involved in COPI-vesicle formation. Increases coatomer-dependent GTPase-activating activity of ARFGAP2 which mediates the hydrolysis of ARF1-bound GTP and therefore modulates protein trafficking from the Golgi apparatus. Involved in the exocytic trafficking of G protein-coupled receptors F2LR1/PAR2 (trypsin and tryspin-like enzyme receptor), OPRM1 (opioid receptor) and P2RY4 (UTD and UDP receptor) from the Golgi to the plasma membrane, thus contributing to receptor resensitization. In addition to its cargo receptor activity, may also act as a protein channel after oligomerization, facilitating the post-translational entry of leaderless cytoplasmic cargo into the ERGIC. Involved in the translocation into ERGIC, the vesicle entry and the secretion of leaderless cargos (lacking the secretion signal sequence), including the mature form of interleukin 1/IL-1 family members, the alpha-crystallin B chain HSPB5, the carbohydrate-binding proteins galectin-1/LGALS1 and galectin-3/LGALS3, the microtubule-associated protein Tau/MAPT, and the annexin A1/ANXA1; the translocation process is dependent on cargo protein unfolding and enhanced by chaperones HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1/GRP9. Could also associates with the presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase complex in order to regulate gamma-cleavages of the amyloid beta A4 protein to yield amyloid-beta 40/Abeta40 (By similarity)			207-219, 207-219, 207-219, 207-219 regions remain disordered in the complex, with Transmembrane emp24 domain-containing protein 10 based on NMR data.	pdb:1p23		Fuzzy interactions facilitate the p24 conformational change while bound to p23, leading to p24 polymerisation and formation of the COPI-coated vesicle.

FC00403	Q73369	Protein Vpr	Protein Vpr	NMR	52-96, 52-96	During virus replication, may deplete host UNG protein, and incude G2-M cell cycle arrest. Acts by targeting specific host proteins for degradation by the 26S proteasome, through association with the cellular CUL4A-DDB1 E3 ligase complex by direct interaction with host VPRPB/DCAF-1. Cell cycle arrest reportedly occurs within hours of infection and is not blocked by antiviral agents, suggesting that it is initiated by the VPR carried into the virion. Additionally, VPR induces apoptosis in a cell cycle dependent manner suggesting that these two effects are mechanistically linked. Detected in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of AIDS patient, VPR may also induce cell death to bystander cellsDuring virus entry, plays a role in the transport of the viral pre-integration (PIC) complex to the host nucleus.
